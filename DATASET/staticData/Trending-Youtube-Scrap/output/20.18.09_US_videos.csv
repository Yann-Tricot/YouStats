It just keeps giving us more. That more came from Cardi B calling it quits in her marriage with Offset, citing cheating as the reason. She is seeking sole custody of their daughter, Kulture. The hearing is set for November 4th. To many it was a surprise but Cardi has been hinting at the split the past few months. Individually, they are both accomplished artists in hip hop, making the two a power couple. Cardi B and Offset’s romance began back in 2017. They collaborated on Cardi B’s song Lick before making it official on Instagram. They moved very fast and were married secretly by September of that year. Soon there was trouble in paradise as Offset was accused of cheating. A video made rounds on social media and Cardi confirmed the rumours herself in an interview with Cosmopolitan. She forgave him but the rumours didn’t stop. Up until her filing for divorce, there was always speculation. Ultimately, infidelity was the reason Cardi filed for divorce. As we wait for the court hearing, let us know your opinions about their relationship. Do you think they will stay separated this time? Will Cardi be able to get sole custody? Follow us so you can stay up-to-date with the latest in their news and pop culture.

"O1yKqLHwea8","Brooklyn's BOYFRIEND Reveal! | 10 Dates in 10 Days","2020-09-16T21:00:03Z","UC6QWhGQqf0YDYdRb0n6ojWw","Brooklyn and Bailey","24","20.18.09","[none]","1088564","62625","437","8106","https://i.ytimg.com/vi/O1yKqLHwea8/default.jpg","False","False","Back in late July and early August, I took a trip out to Utah to film #10DatesIn10Days. All of the dates were amazing, with 10 phenomenal guys! We promised y'all that I would pick one of them to go on a second date with. (Well... its actually a little more than that!❤️ #boyfriend) Today I FINALLY get to reveal to y'all who he is!✅ Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry/Hair Accessories and more... HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) brooklynandbaileyshop.comAs mentioned during the series, we did our best to follow CDC guidelines in mask wearing, hand washing, social distancing, etc, during each of the dates. We crammed in 2-3 dates per day (Hollywood magic), due to my limited schedule. In fact, before each of the dates... the boys had to either take a covid test or confirm that they had been social distancing for 10-14 days, as I did. In fact, we had to replace 2 of the boys who confirmed that they either had covid or were in close contact with someone who had it in the days leading up to our date. It turns out that the GUY I CHOSE ended up being ONE OF THE REPLACEMENTS!!! When the original date canceled due to covid, Betsy Mikesell and Kaitlyn were SCRAMBLING to find a replacement with only days notice. Kaitlyn remembered a cute family she had taken family photos for 3 years ago, and that they had a son who seemed super nice and really handsome. He had since returned from a 2-year LDS mission to Madagascar, and finished his first year at BYU. When she reached out to him via DM about filling in on this date, he finally remembered who she was, listened to the dating series idea, and said YES!❤️ Watch the whole 10 DATES IN 10 DAYS SERIES here!!!  👉🏻 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj0H71LavJZ9_jfT_YnHxeUkn7yvpDecSWhen we went on our date, we had SO MUCH FUN! I didn't want it to end, and we made excuses (intentionally) to extend the date as long as we could despite the day's hectic #dating schedule.This boy was also the first person I texted when I heard from my mom about the Mikesell's plane crash during one of my last dates. (Everyone survived because of miracles, but there were major injuries... https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU) He helped console me, gave me advice on how to manage the rest of the day, helped Betsy coordinate picking me up, and dropped everything to drive to the Mikesell's and help out in any way he could. Those next several days, he would run any errand Betsy and Brock & Boston needed, praying over them, helping clean the house and taking care of the family dog. He had never met the Mikesell's before. Needless to say, I was VERY impressed!In the 6 weeks since, we've texted/FaceTimed every single day. My extended family was dying to know who I had chosen, as did my friends and hundreds of thousands of you! It was hard not share this all with y'all, because we knew we needed to film this video first! He would send me flowers, or often Postmates my favorite foods, etc, all the time. I wanted SO BAD to share this all with you, but knew I couldn't!We knew we wouldn't see each other until the 16th of September, when he planned to fly out for a visit. Little did I know, but, Bailey and my mom had been planning to fly him out early as a SURPRISE for me! I LITERALLY HAD NO IDEA, because he wasn't supposed to show up for three more days! So last Sunday he showed up in Dallas, and Bailey and my mom filmed my reaction. Then we both sat down and filmed a segment to share a little about how we got to where were are! I am SO HAPPY! What was your reaction when you found out who I chose? What was your favorite part of the video?

We started with a focus on auto settings for this review. PCIe 4 vs. PCIe 3 tests were also completed, and we chose the fastest platform for this comparison (but we do have Gen3 vs. Gen4 benchmarks coming shortly). The RTX game results, particularly for fully path-traced games, produced interesting data when looking at scaling vs. the 2080 Ti, but 'normal' games are also included.TIMESTAMPS00:00 - RTX 3080 Review Premise01:51 - The Cooler Interests & Basic RTX 3080 Specs02:58 - RTX 3080 VRAM Limitations & 10GB vs. 11-12GB04:51 - Pressure Testing of RTX 3080 Founders Edition06:50 - Coldplate Flatness of RTX 3080 FE Cooler08:12 - RTX 3080 Frequency vs. Temperature09:12 - Fan RPM Behavior vs. GPU Temperature09:51 - Noise Levels Over Time for FE Card10:58 - Fan Speed vs. Noise Level & Harmonics11:49 - Games - Red Dead Redemption 2 GPU Benchmarks14:15 - Vulkan vs. Dx12 API Performance on RTX 3080 GPU15:01 - Rainbow Six Siege GPU Benchmarks (RTX 3080 vs. 2080 Ti, et al)15:46 - Unstable Overclock Frametime Plot17:02 - Tomb Raider RTX 3080 vs. 1080 Ti, 5700 XT, Etc18:13 - Microsoft Flight Simulator GPU Benchmarks18:46 - F1 2019 Crashed on 3080, But Fixed After Launch18:59 - Horizon Zero Dawn GPU Benchmarks19:38 - Three Kingdoms, The Division 2, GTA V Benchmarks20:07 - RTX Game Benchmarks on Minecraft21:34 - Control RTX Benchmarks & DLSS On vs. Off22:19 - Insane Scaling in Quake II RTX23:01 - Power Consumption of RTX 3080 vs. 2080, Ti, 1080 Ti, et al25:20 - RTX 3080 Overclock Stepping Chart26:11 - Conclusion: Cooling Solution, Gaming, & MoreLike our content?

It sounds innocuous enough, but a cursory glimpse at any given recipe eschews batter in favor of a sturdier, more reliable flour-and-egg dredge. Thanks to our new kitchen producer (Kendall Beach), we concocted a formula for batter that wouldn't bulk up, wouldn't brown too quickly, and wouldn't crack in the unforgiving oil. The results are annoyingly difficult but undeniably fantastic fried chicken, made in (what I imagine is) the Pollos Hermanos style!Recipe: https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/recipes/pollos-hermanos-breaking-badMusic: “unna” / XXV by Broke for Freehttps://soundcloud.com/broke-for-freeMy playlist of preferred cooking tunes, Bangers with Babish!https://spoti.fi/2TYXmiYBinging With Babish Website: http://bit.ly/BingingBabishWebsiteBasics With Babish Website: http://bit.ly/BasicsWithBabishWebsitePatreon: http://bit.ly/BingingPatreonInstagram: http://bit.ly/BabishInstagramFacebook: http://bit.ly/BabishFacebookTwitter: http://bit.ly/BabishTwitter","PT6M59S"

Cook the pasta according to package instructions in unsalted water (the sauce is very salty; if using fresh noodles, cook them at the start of step 2). Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large skillet or saucepan over medium heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant but not browned, about 2 minutes. Add the oyster sauce, soy sauce, and fish and stir to combine.2. Using tongs, transfer the cooked noodles to the garlic sauce. Increase heat to high, add cheese and scallions, and stir and toss vigorously until the sauce is creamy and emulsified, about 30 seconds. If sauce looks too watery, let it keep reducing. If it looks greasy, splash some more pasta water into it and let it reemulsify. Serve immediately.","PT15M47S"
