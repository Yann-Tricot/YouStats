With BTS cooped up in Seoul, the group held true to the series's spirit by convening a live band for its Tiny Desk debut, and even arranged to perform in a workspace with a music-friendly backdrop: the record store VINYL & PLASTIC by Hyundai Card in BTS's hometown.Opening with this summer's inescapable Dynamite — the group's first single to hit No. 1 in the U.S., as well as its first song to be fully recorded in English — BTS leaned hard into the new track's celebratory, Uptown Funk-adjacent vibes. From there, the group dipped into its back catalog, seizing on the opportunity to showcase its quieter side while (mostly) staying uncharacteristically seated. The breezily propulsive Save ME, from 2016, ultimately gave way to a full-on power ballad in 2017's reflective Spring Day.The latter track seemed especially true to BTS's hopeful nature: Introduced with a few optimistic words from rapper and singer RM (It's been the roughest summer ever, but we know that spring will come), the song reflects on a need to wait out hard times, even as the weight of present-day pain feels oppressive.BTS had intended to spend 2020 delighting the BTS Army in arenas around the world, only to spend these last few months performing in isolation. Released on the last day of a grim season, Spring Day provides a nice reminder of what awaits us on the other side. We just have to get through fall and winter first.SET LISTDynamiteSave MESpring DayMUSICIANSV: vocals; Jin: vocals; Jimin: vocals; J-Hope: vocals; RM: vocals; SUGA: vocals; Jungkook: vocals; KHAN: drums; DOCSKIM: keyboard; Kim Kiwook: bass; Shyun: guitarCREDITSVideo and Audio by: Big Hit Entertainment; Producer: Stephen Thompson; Audio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Video Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya GrundmannABOUT THE SERIESThe Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future.

Unfortunately one of my childhood pets got sick and passed away very suddenly. He has been unwell for a little while but things began to escalate at a very fast pace. He was the most beautiful pet I could have ever asked for and I'm so happy I had the experience of having him by my side for a large portion of my life. I will never forget him.I'm currently in a lot of pain and trying my best to deal with things and I just can't do videos. I have several pre-recorded videos that I can edit so I may do that but I'm unsure if I can. I'll try to be back by the end of the week or sooner but I really can't predict how I'll be feeling. Thank you for reading this and please look after your pets. Treat them like every day is their last and always be kind to them, they deserve it and love you.Get some 8-BitRyan merch here! - http://8bitryan.fanfiber.comTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/iam8bitryanCheck out my Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/8bitryan/?hl=enFollow me on Twitter - https://twitter.com/IAm8BitRyanMusic:Myuu: http://youtube.com/myuujiKevin Macleod: http://incompetech.com/wordpress/Ironside Click here to customize your own PC - https://ironsidecomputers.com/","PT2M38S"

For access to live and exclusive video from CNBC subscribe to CNBC PRO: https://cnb.cx/2NGeIvi Microsoft announced Monday that it will buy ZeniMax Media, the company that owns well-known video game publisher Bethesda, for $7.5 billion in cash.It’s the biggest gaming acquisition in Microsoft’s history. The company bought Mojang, the studio behind popular title Minecraft, for $2.5 billion in late 2014. That proved to be a boon to the firm as Minecraft continued to surge in popularity, rapidly becoming the world’s best-selling game with over 200 million copies sold to date.The acquisition of Bethesda gives Microsoft access to a raft of successful game franchises, including the role-playing game series Fallout and The Elder Scrolls and the Doom shooter franchise.“Gaming is the most expansive category in the entertainment industry, as people everywhere turn to gaming to connect, socialize and play with their friends,” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said.“With the addition of Bethesda, Microsoft will grow from 15 to 23 creative studio teams and will be adding Bethesda’s iconic franchises to Xbox Game Pass,” Microsoft said. “This includes Microsoft’s intent to bring Bethesda’s future games into Xbox Game Pass the same day they launch on Xbox or PC.”Microsoft’s Xbox unit is betting heavily on subscriptions this year. Its Xbox Game Pass platform gives players access to dozens of games and the firm recently included a so-called cloud gaming feature that lets users play games on their phone or tablet. Microsoft said it aims to bring Bethesda’s upcoming space-themed game Starfield to Xbox Game Pass on the day of launch.Microsoft is also selling its new Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S consoles — which will go head-to-head with Sony’s PlayStation 5 next month — via point-of-sale financing plans to spread the cost over monthly installments.

L'objectif est similaire à Koh-Lanta: survivre plus de 24h sans eau et sans électricité. Nous allons parcourir plus de 10km à pied dans les montagnes rocheuses de l'ouest canadien (proche de Banff en Alberta) pour vivre cette expérience 24h hors du commun. 👉 Merci à Elevated Escape de m'avoir permis de vivre l'expérience Glamping sans eau et sans électricité: https://bit.ly/3hPKKSh👉 Rejoins la famille en t’abonnant à ma chaîne: http://bit.ly/2gcKjr9 Ouesh.:signe_de_main_v:👉 Toutes les photos & behind the scene, sur Instagram: http://bit.ly/2LYxPy8Pendant les 24 prochaines heures, je vais devoir marcher en forêt vers un campement sur un terrain de camping sécurisé, de type Glamping, soigneusement préparé par Elevated Escape qui se situe à 10km de mon point de départ. Je ne vais avoir ni accès à de l'eau potable, ni à de l'électricité durant ce parcours, je vais devoir trouver de l’eau en chemin pour pouvoir survivre dans la nature, un peu comme l'émission Into the Wild, You VS Wild. Il est très important de boire beaucoup d’eau lorsqu’on fait un effort physique ou quand il fait chaud, comme les plus grands sportifs le recommandent. Notre corps dépense beaucoup de calories lors d'efforts physiques, et le corps a besoin de liquide comme de l'eau, du Gatorade, des boissons à base de vitamines ou encore contenant du sucre comme du Coca-cola, du Fanta, Schweppes et Orangina afin de combattre la fatigue et hydrater les muscles. L'objectif de la journée est de se rendre au campement avant le coucher du soleil sans GPS, ni téléphone portable (iPhone, tablette, iPad ou ordinateur). Je n'ai aucun accès à la technologie, rien pour m'aider à me retrouver, ni même une boussole que j'aurais pu me procurer chez Decathlon ou Sport Expert par exemple. Je vais avoir une carte, une sorte de map monde, mais simplement de la ville de Banff en Alberta, qui va me servir pour retrouver mon sentier et ne pas me perdre en chemin.Je me suis rendue compte que n'importe quel accessoire de camping ou de survie peut-être utile lorsque l'on se retrouver seul dans la nature: lampe frontale, chaussures de randonnées, gourdes, sac de couchage, pull-over et vêtements en laine chauds. Une fois arrivé à la tente, l'objectif est de se préparer un feu de camp de type scoot ou comme en survie, typique Red Dead Redemption, pour me réchauffer et essayer d'y voir quelque chose sans la pénombre. Si j'en ai la possibilité, nous cuisinerons ensemble un petit plat sur une petite cuisinière spéciale camping, avec des ustensiles de cuisine comme des couteaux, fourchette, cuillères, casseroles, bref tout le nécessaire qui peut se retrouver chez Ikea ou dans des magasins de décoration pour la maison.Pour cette vidéo survie, je me suis préparé en regardant quelques tutoriels de survie de l’explorateur le plus connu du monde: Mike Horn sur sa chaine Youtube. Sans conseils, je ne pourrais pas survivre dans la forêt canadienne aussi longtemps avec aussi peu d’équipement. J’ai quand même pris avec moi un couteau suisse, un allume feu, une carte d’exploration, un manteau et une casquette dans mon sac à dos.Lien vers la vidéo sur les 12 techniques de survie essentielles dans la nature de @Mike Horn: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjgNi66o2KELorsque j’arrive à destination, Elevated Escape m’ont préparé une expérience de camping glamour, glamping, avec une tente de luxe, un espace pour faire un feu de camp pour pouvoir se réchauffer, une table à pique-nique et tout le nécessaire de camping qu’on peut trouver dans tous les meilleurs détaillant de produits de camping. Bien sûr, aucun équipement ne sera alimenté par de l’électricité et je n’aurai pas d’eau à ma disposition.Comme nous sommes en constante immersion dans les technologies électroniques et que nous avons de l’eau à portée de main à tous les jours de notre vie dans le confort de notre foyer, nous ne réalisons pas à quel point nous sommes dépendants des gadgets électroniques et qu’il est important de limiter notre consommation d’eau pour que les réserves ne s’épuisent pas.Vidéo de DENYZEECette chaîne est une chaîne youtube de divertissement et d’humour.

Here is a short video explaining what happened and what needs to happen with our boat. At least as far as we can tell at this point.This is  a very simplified explanation to give an idea of what's going on. It may be helpful to think of this as an outline for a very large term paper due at the end of the semester, and not the term paper itself. There is obviously a LOT more detail and depth into the means, methods, and materials of the repairs we have before us, and we will talk about those more as we get to each step in the repair. This is certainly not a full understanding nor an end of the explaining! We will continue to learn and explain as we go.As far as the background of the damage - we are discovering more all the time. For example, we now think there is good chance that the boat was grounded at least twice. One time, several years ago which was repaired, and then a second time more recently. We may never know for sure and at the end of the day what matters is the boat's future and not its past. Well sort of, obviously its past is affecting us very much at the moment, haha. With loveThe Evans'ps.We have been consulting with many different types professionals from the very beginning, even before we purchased the boat and continually after. We have talked it over with marine architects, experienced repairmen, our surveyor and Beneteau America. All of which have seen this damage before and have seen it successfully repaired. We appreciate those of you who have expressed concern for our safety. It's nice to have so many people looking out for us, both on the internet but more importantly in person, watching over, inspecting, guiding, etc. We are young and naïve, no arguments there, but we are also educated, strategic, and gritty. We purchased the boat knowing that we didn't know enough, but confident that we could learn what we needed to. We obviously can't guarantee anything - but there's really no reason why we can't fix it or that it won't be a great investment for us, both emotionally and financially.As far as finances go, both of us losing our source of income at the same time definitely threw a wrench in our plans. But you guys - with how terrible 2020 is for so many, we refuse to complain even a little bit. Real sorrow, real pain makes our little hiccup seem very small. We are hoping to be back to work sooner than later, like so many others. Luckily for us, we're very well practiced at getting on with very little money. It's like living the good 'ole newlywed phase all over again.*****************************************Our Boat*2008 Beneteau 493 cabin 2 head4JH4-TE Westerbeke generatorMast, sails and rig are in excellent condition and in storageHere's what we *think* we know about her past. Keep in mind we bought her at auction without ever meeting the owner! The owner was sailing along and ran aground - hard. Hard enough that the keel pivoted and pushed the aft end up into the hull. This force cracked the internal grid in several places and broke a portion of the grid free from hull. At some point an inspection was done, insurance was called and decisions were made.

We grew up together since we were 3 years old and her family introduced me to Japanese culture. I ate Japanese food for breakfast and as afterschool snacks, her dad taught me how to use chopsticks and how to properly make green tea, and I fell in love with onigiri at a young age. Miki's mom would make me a plate full of bite sized onigiri on my b-day. She's a lovely friend and I'm lucky to have met such a great person at such a young age  :)-------J-Town is located at: 3160 Steeles Ave E, Markham, ON L3R 4G9-----Subscribe for more videos:☞ http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=simonandmartinaLike what we’re doing and want to show your support? 🌈 Join the Rainbow Ladder Support Team!☞ https://www.youtube.com/simonandmartina/join☞https://www.instagram.com/eatyourkimchi☞https://twitter.com/eatyourkimchiGet cozy in our hoodies, t-shirts, hats, and more☞http://www.eatyourkimchi.com/shop/BABY WHEN YOU MOVE YOUR BODAY!

The home is on the grid for electricity, and it has it's own well and septic system.  It was really exciting and inspiring for us to meet Mike and his partner Gen, and to hear the story of how the tiny tree house cabin idea came to life after visiting tiny houses and treehouses on their travels, and how they made it a reality by building with scrap and leftover materials that Mike had collected from job sites for years.We hope you enjoyed touring it as much as we did!Thanks for watching!Mat & Danielle-------------------------------------------------------------STAY IN TOUCH!-------------------------------------------------------------Blog: www.exploringalternatives.caFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/exploringalternativesblogInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/exploringalternatives/-------------------------------------------------------------COMMENTS-------------------------------------------------------------We want our channel and our comments section to be an inclusive space where everyone feels welcome to watch and to contribute.

Today we mourn, but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her — a tireless and resolute champion of justice,” Roberts said in a statement.Ginsburg had announced in July that she was undergoing chemotherapy treatment for lesions on her liver, the latest of her several battles with cancer.Born Joan Ruth Bader on March 15, 1933 in Brooklyn, New York, she was the youngest of two children to Nathan and Celia Bader. It was when Ginsburg was in kindergarten that she decided to go by her middle name Ruth, according to Encyclopedia Britannica.Ginsburg grew up in a low-income, working-class neighborhood of Brooklyn, where her father worked as a merchant and her mother worked at a clothing factory. Her older sister, Marilyn, died of meningitis when Ginsburg was only a baby.  Watch what’s happening right NOW from FOX.
