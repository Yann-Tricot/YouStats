Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.Sept. 21, 2020 | Stephen Thompson -- We've been trying to make a BTS Tiny Desk concert happen for years now — even gaming out ways we might move Bob Boilen's desk far enough forward to accommodate the superstar Korean boy band's dance moves.In the end, it took a global pandemic — and the launch of Tiny Desk (home) concerts back in March — to make something happen. With BTS cooped up in Seoul, the group held true to the series's spirit by convening a live band for its Tiny Desk debut, and even arranged to perform in a workspace with a music-friendly backdrop: the record store VINYL & PLASTIC by Hyundai Card in BTS's hometown.Opening with this summer's inescapable Dynamite — the group's first single to hit No. 1 in the U.S., as well as its first song to be fully recorded in English — BTS leaned hard into the new track's celebratory, Uptown Funk-adjacent vibes. From there, the group dipped into its back catalog, seizing on the opportunity to showcase its quieter side while (mostly) staying uncharacteristically seated. The breezily propulsive Save ME, from 2016, ultimately gave way to a full-on power ballad in 2017's reflective Spring Day.The latter track seemed especially true to BTS's hopeful nature: Introduced with a few optimistic words from rapper and singer RM (It's been the roughest summer ever, but we know that spring will come), the song reflects on a need to wait out hard times, even as the weight of present-day pain feels oppressive.BTS had intended to spend 2020 delighting the BTS Army in arenas around the world, only to spend these last few months performing in isolation. Released on the last day of a grim season, Spring Day provides a nice reminder of what awaits us on the other side. We just have to get through fall and winter first.SET LISTDynamiteSave MESpring DayMUSICIANSV: vocals; Jin: vocals; Jimin: vocals; J-Hope: vocals; RM: vocals; SUGA: vocals; Jungkook: vocals; KHAN: drums; DOCSKIM: keyboard; Kim Kiwook: bass; Shyun: guitarCREDITSVideo and Audio by: Big Hit Entertainment; Producer: Stephen Thompson; Audio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Video Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann","PT14M7S"

We grew up together since we were 3 years old and her family introduced me to Japanese culture. I ate Japanese food for breakfast and as afterschool snacks, her dad taught me how to use chopsticks and how to properly make green tea, and I fell in love with onigiri at a young age. Miki's mom would make me a plate full of bite sized onigiri on my b-day.

Il fait mal au cerveau et au corps... Pourquoi ?

Le but ? Comprendre ce qu'il se passe dans nos cerveaux avec ces notions.

En France, Suisse, Belgique, Luxembourg puis dans quelques semaines à peine au Canada.Une version audio du livre ? Je suis en train de l'enregistrer en studio actuellement.

Pour les salons, librairies et magasins la situation actuelle ne le permet pas vraiment. Je vous tiens au courant sur Instagram et sur mon site internet.Il est en rupture, que faire ? Que vous soyez dans un lieu ou en ligne commandez-le, en général ils en ont de nouveaux quelques jours après (même si ils affichent 2 à 3 semaines, c'est le message générique).

The home is on the grid for electricity, and it has it's own well and septic system.  It was really exciting and inspiring for us to meet Mike and his partner Gen, and to hear the story of how the tiny tree house cabin idea came to life after visiting tiny houses and treehouses on their travels, and how they made it a reality by building with scrap and leftover materials that Mike had collected from job sites for years.We hope you enjoyed touring it as much as we did!Thanks for watching!Mat & Danielle-------------------------------------------------------------STAY IN TOUCH!-------------------------------------------------------------Blog: www.exploringalternatives.caFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/exploringalternativesblogInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/exploringalternatives/-------------------------------------------------------------COMMENTS-------------------------------------------------------------We want our channel and our comments section to be an inclusive space where everyone feels welcome to watch and to contribute.

L'objectif est similaire à Koh-Lanta: survivre plus de 24h sans eau et sans électricité. Nous allons parcourir plus de 10km à pied dans les montagnes rocheuses de l'ouest canadien (proche de Banff en Alberta) pour vivre cette expérience 24h hors du commun. 👉 Merci à Elevated Escape de m'avoir permis de vivre l'expérience Glamping sans eau et sans électricité: https://bit.ly/3hPKKSh👉 Rejoins la famille en t’abonnant à ma chaîne: http://bit.ly/2gcKjr9 Ouesh.:signe_de_main_v:👉 Toutes les photos & behind the scene, sur Instagram: http://bit.ly/2LYxPy8Pendant les 24 prochaines heures, je vais devoir marcher en forêt vers un campement sur un terrain de camping sécurisé, de type Glamping, soigneusement préparé par Elevated Escape qui se situe à 10km de mon point de départ. Je ne vais avoir ni accès à de l'eau potable, ni à de l'électricité durant ce parcours, je vais devoir trouver de l’eau en chemin pour pouvoir survivre dans la nature, un peu comme l'émission Into the Wild, You VS Wild. Il est très important de boire beaucoup d’eau lorsqu’on fait un effort physique ou quand il fait chaud, comme les plus grands sportifs le recommandent. Notre corps dépense beaucoup de calories lors d'efforts physiques, et le corps a besoin de liquide comme de l'eau, du Gatorade, des boissons à base de vitamines ou encore contenant du sucre comme du Coca-cola, du Fanta, Schweppes et Orangina afin de combattre la fatigue et hydrater les muscles. L'objectif de la journée est de se rendre au campement avant le coucher du soleil sans GPS, ni téléphone portable (iPhone, tablette, iPad ou ordinateur). Je n'ai aucun accès à la technologie, rien pour m'aider à me retrouver, ni même une boussole que j'aurais pu me procurer chez Decathlon ou Sport Expert par exemple. Je vais avoir une carte, une sorte de map monde, mais simplement de la ville de Banff en Alberta, qui va me servir pour retrouver mon sentier et ne pas me perdre en chemin.Je me suis rendue compte que n'importe quel accessoire de camping ou de survie peut-être utile lorsque l'on se retrouver seul dans la nature: lampe frontale, chaussures de randonnées, gourdes, sac de couchage, pull-over et vêtements en laine chauds. Une fois arrivé à la tente, l'objectif est de se préparer un feu de camp de type scoot ou comme en survie, typique Red Dead Redemption, pour me réchauffer et essayer d'y voir quelque chose sans la pénombre. Si j'en ai la possibilité, nous cuisinerons ensemble un petit plat sur une petite cuisinière spéciale camping, avec des ustensiles de cuisine comme des couteaux, fourchette, cuillères, casseroles, bref tout le nécessaire qui peut se retrouver chez Ikea ou dans des magasins de décoration pour la maison.Pour cette vidéo survie, je me suis préparé en regardant quelques tutoriels de survie de l’explorateur le plus connu du monde: Mike Horn sur sa chaine Youtube. Sans conseils, je ne pourrais pas survivre dans la forêt canadienne aussi longtemps avec aussi peu d’équipement.

Today we mourn, but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her — a tireless and resolute champion of justice,” Roberts said in a statement.Ginsburg had announced in July that she was undergoing chemotherapy treatment for lesions on her liver, the latest of her several battles with cancer.Born Joan Ruth Bader on March 15, 1933 in Brooklyn, New York, she was the youngest of two children to Nathan and Celia Bader. It was when Ginsburg was in kindergarten that she decided to go by her middle name Ruth, according to Encyclopedia Britannica.Ginsburg grew up in a low-income, working-class neighborhood of Brooklyn, where her father worked as a merchant and her mother worked at a clothing factory. Her older sister, Marilyn, died of meningitis when Ginsburg was only a baby.  Watch what’s happening right NOW from FOX.

So I wanted to dedicate a video to testing out the art trends that I've noticed around social media in the past year, but have never actually taken the time to try out. Last time I did this, I tried hydro dipping and it was a complete mess.....literally. This time I am doing acrylic pour, sometimes called pouring art or fluid art. This is a super satisfying form of art that has been trending for the last couple of years. This is also much bigger than a trend, many professional artists use paint pouring as their primary form of art. I must say, this was so fun to try. It's such a creative, relaxing and super satisfying abstract art form. At the same time, it would be easy for someone at any skill level to create. I hope you enjoy watching my test out this trend for the first time!Don't forget to check out my train of a hydro dipping video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaLrWkWuDjw&t=352s&ab_channel=MoriahElizabethHere is the kit I am using (affiliate link):   https://amzn.to/3c8X6Ur___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh 😂 ) and this is my channel....obviously.

I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.
