And along with that, we have some interesting updates on the human landing system by Dynetics and some updates on Astra‚Äôs launch failure from Alaska.SUPPORT ME ON PATREON - https://www.patreon.com/marcushouseJOIN MY DISCORD - https://discord.gg/dAMmbqjFOLLOW ON TWITTER - https://twitter.com/MarcusHouseGameThanks to the production crew:  Brenton Myers,  Brendan Lewis,  GameplayReviewUKA HUGE THANK YOU TO---------------------------------------Neopork (graphics/animations and thumbnail)https://twitter.com/Neopork85https://www.patreon.com/NeoporkGameplayReviewUK - Starships SN5 and SN6 Recreated in Kerbal Space Programhttps://youtu.be/bVkq3isEHmANASASpaceFlight - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSUu1lih2RifWkKtDOJdsBABocaChicaGal - https://twitter.com/BocaChicaGalRGVAerialPhotographyhttps://www.patreon.com/RGVaerialhttps://www.youtube.com/c/RGVAerialPhotographyLab Padrehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFwMITSkc1Fms6PoJoh1OUQMUSICDeliberate Thought by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)Source: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/?keywords=deliberate+thoughtArtist: http://incompetech.com/","PT18M19S"

L'objectif est similaire √† Koh-Lanta: survivre plus de 24h sans eau et sans √©lectricit√©. Nous allons parcourir plus de 10km √† pied dans les montagnes rocheuses de l'ouest canadien (proche de Banff en Alberta) pour vivre cette exp√©rience 24h hors du commun. üëâ Merci √† Elevated Escape de m'avoir permis de vivre l'exp√©rience Glamping sans eau et sans √©lectricit√©: https://bit.ly/3hPKKShüëâ Rejoins la famille en t‚Äôabonnant √† ma cha√Æne: http://bit.ly/2gcKjr9 Ouesh.:signe_de_main_v:üëâ Toutes les photos & behind the scene, sur Instagram: http://bit.ly/2LYxPy8Pendant les 24 prochaines heures, je vais devoir marcher en for√™t vers un campement sur un terrain de camping s√©curis√©, de type Glamping, soigneusement pr√©par√© par Elevated Escape qui se situe √† 10km de mon point de d√©part. Je ne vais avoir ni acc√®s √† de l'eau potable, ni √† de l'√©lectricit√© durant ce parcours, je vais devoir trouver de l‚Äôeau en chemin pour pouvoir survivre dans la nature, un peu comme l'√©mission Into the Wild, You VS Wild. Il est tr√®s important de boire beaucoup d‚Äôeau lorsqu‚Äôon fait un effort physique ou quand il fait chaud, comme les plus grands sportifs le recommandent. Notre corps d√©pense beaucoup de calories lors d'efforts physiques, et le corps a besoin de liquide comme de l'eau, du Gatorade, des boissons √† base de vitamines ou encore contenant du sucre comme du Coca-cola, du Fanta, Schweppes et Orangina afin de combattre la fatigue et hydrater les muscles. L'objectif de la journ√©e est de se rendre au campement avant le coucher du soleil sans GPS, ni t√©l√©phone portable (iPhone, tablette, iPad ou ordinateur). Je n'ai aucun acc√®s √† la technologie, rien pour m'aider √† me retrouver, ni m√™me une boussole que j'aurais pu me procurer chez Decathlon ou Sport Expert par exemple. Je vais avoir une carte, une sorte de map monde, mais simplement de la ville de Banff en Alberta, qui va me servir pour retrouver mon sentier et ne pas me perdre en chemin.Je me suis rendue compte que n'importe quel accessoire de camping ou de survie peut-√™tre utile lorsque l'on se retrouver seul dans la nature: lampe frontale, chaussures de randonn√©es, gourdes, sac de couchage, pull-over et v√™tements en laine chauds. Une fois arriv√© √† la tente, l'objectif est de se pr√©parer un feu de camp de type scoot ou comme en survie, typique Red Dead Redemption, pour me r√©chauffer et essayer d'y voir quelque chose sans la p√©nombre. Si j'en ai la possibilit√©, nous cuisinerons ensemble un petit plat sur une petite cuisini√®re sp√©ciale camping, avec des ustensiles de cuisine comme des couteaux, fourchette, cuill√®res, casseroles, bref tout le n√©cessaire qui peut se retrouver chez Ikea ou dans des magasins de d√©coration pour la maison.Pour cette vid√©o survie, je me suis pr√©par√© en regardant quelques tutoriels de survie de l‚Äôexplorateur le plus connu du monde: Mike Horn sur sa chaine Youtube. Sans conseils, je ne pourrais pas survivre dans la for√™t canadienne aussi longtemps avec aussi peu d‚Äô√©quipement.

Bien s√ªr, aucun √©quipement ne sera aliment√© par de l‚Äô√©lectricit√© et je n‚Äôaurai pas d‚Äôeau √† ma disposition.Comme nous sommes en constante immersion dans les technologies √©lectroniques et que nous avons de l‚Äôeau √† port√©e de main √† tous les jours de notre vie dans le confort de notre foyer, nous ne r√©alisons pas √† quel point nous sommes d√©pendants des gadgets √©lectroniques et qu‚Äôil est important de limiter notre consommation d‚Äôeau pour que les r√©serves ne s‚Äô√©puisent pas.Vid√©o de DENYZEECette cha√Æne est une cha√Æne youtube de divertissement et d‚Äôhumour.

So I wanted to dedicate a video to testing out the art trends that I've noticed around social media in the past year, but have never actually taken the time to try out. Last time I did this, I tried hydro dipping and it was a complete mess.....literally. This time I am doing acrylic pour, sometimes called pouring art or fluid art. This is a super satisfying form of art that has been trending for the last couple of years. This is also much bigger than a trend, many professional artists use paint pouring as their primary form of art. I must say, this was so fun to try. It's such a creative, relaxing and super satisfying abstract art form. At the same time, it would be easy for someone at any skill level to create. I hope you enjoy watching my test out this trend for the first time!Don't forget to check out my train of a hydro dipping video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaLrWkWuDjw&t=352s&ab_channel=MoriahElizabethHere is the kit I am using (affiliate link):   https://amzn.to/3c8X6Ur___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL).

All of the dates were amazing, with 10 phenomenal guys! We promised y'all that I would pick one of them to go on a second date with. (Well... its actually a little more than that!‚ù§Ô∏è #boyfriend) Today I FINALLY get to reveal to y'all who he is!‚úÖ Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry/Hair Accessories and more... HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) brooklynandbaileyshop.comAs mentioned during the series, we did our best to follow CDC guidelines in mask wearing, hand washing, social distancing, etc, during each of the dates. We crammed in 2-3 dates per day (Hollywood magic), due to my limited schedule. In fact, before each of the dates... the boys had to either take a covid test or confirm that they had been social distancing for 10-14 days, as I did. In fact, we had to replace 2 of the boys who confirmed that they either had covid or were in close contact with someone who had it in the days leading up to our date. It turns out that the GUY I CHOSE ended up being ONE OF THE REPLACEMENTS!!! When the original date canceled due to covid, Betsy Mikesell and Kaitlyn were SCRAMBLING to find a replacement with only days notice. Kaitlyn remembered a cute family she had taken family photos for 3 years ago, and that they had a son who seemed super nice and really handsome. He had since returned from a 2-year LDS mission to Madagascar, and finished his first year at BYU. When she reached out to him via DM about filling in on this date, he finally remembered who she was, listened to the dating series idea, and said YES!‚ù§Ô∏è Watch the whole 10 DATES IN 10 DAYS SERIES here!!!  üëâüèª https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj0H71LavJZ9_jfT_YnHxeUkn7yvpDecSWhen we went on our date, we had SO MUCH FUN! I didn't want it to end, and we made excuses (intentionally) to extend the date as long as we could despite the day's hectic #dating schedule.This boy was also the first person I texted when I heard from my mom about the Mikesell's plane crash during one of my last dates. (Everyone survived because of miracles, but there were major injuries... https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU) He helped console me, gave me advice on how to manage the rest of the day, helped Betsy coordinate picking me up, and dropped everything to drive to the Mikesell's and help out in any way he could. Those next several days, he would run any errand Betsy and Brock & Boston needed, praying over them, helping clean the house and taking care of the family dog. He had never met the Mikesell's before. Needless to say, I was VERY impressed!In the 6 weeks since, we've texted/FaceTimed every single day. My extended family was dying to know who I had chosen, as did my friends and hundreds of thousands of you! It was hard not share this all with y'all, because we knew we needed to film this video first! He would send me flowers, or often Postmates my favorite foods, etc, all the time. I wanted SO BAD to share this all with you, but knew I couldn't!We knew we wouldn't see each other until the 16th of September, when he planned to fly out for a visit. Little did I know, but, Bailey and my mom had been planning to fly him out early as a SURPRISE for me! I LITERALLY HAD NO IDEA, because he wasn't supposed to show up for three more days! So last Sunday he showed up in Dallas, and Bailey and my mom filmed my reaction. Then we both sat down and filmed a segment to share a little about how we got to where were are! I am SO HAPPY!

It just keeps giving us more. That more came from Cardi B calling it quits in her marriage with Offset, citing cheating as the reason. She is seeking sole custody of their daughter, Kulture. The hearing is set for November 4th. To many it was a surprise but Cardi has been hinting at the split the past few months. Individually, they are both accomplished artists in hip hop, making the two a power couple. Cardi B and Offset‚Äôs romance began back in 2017. They collaborated on Cardi B‚Äôs song Lick before making it official on Instagram. They moved very fast and were married secretly by September of that year. Soon there was trouble in paradise as Offset was accused of cheating. A video made rounds on social media and Cardi confirmed the rumours herself in an interview with Cosmopolitan. She forgave him but the rumours didn‚Äôt stop. Up until her filing for divorce, there was always speculation. Ultimately, infidelity was the reason Cardi filed for divorce. As we wait for the court hearing, let us know your opinions about their relationship. Do you think they will stay separated this time? Will Cardi be able to get sole custody? Follow us so you can stay up-to-date with the latest in their news and pop culture.

It sounds innocuous enough, but a cursory glimpse at any given recipe eschews batter in favor of a sturdier, more reliable flour-and-egg dredge. Thanks to our new kitchen producer (Kendall Beach), we concocted a formula for batter that wouldn't bulk up, wouldn't brown too quickly, and wouldn't crack in the unforgiving oil. The results are annoyingly difficult but undeniably fantastic fried chicken, made in (what I imagine is) the Pollos Hermanos style!Recipe: https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/recipes/pollos-hermanos-breaking-badMusic: ‚Äúunna‚Äù / XXV by Broke for Freehttps://soundcloud.com/broke-for-freeMy playlist of preferred cooking tunes, Bangers with Babish!https://spoti.fi/2TYXmiYBinging With Babish Website: http://bit.ly/BingingBabishWebsiteBasics With Babish Website: http://bit.ly/BasicsWithBabishWebsitePatreon: http://bit.ly/BingingPatreonInstagram: http://bit.ly/BabishInstagramFacebook: http://bit.ly/BabishFacebookTwitter: http://bit.ly/BabishTwitter","PT6M59S"
