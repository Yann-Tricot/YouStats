Emily is my actual wife and she is really pregnant right now with our first child, so art imitates life in a fun way with this video. We studied and memorized all of the Korean lyrics to Suga’s incredible and romantic verse and all of the blueberries in the bathtub ended up being reused to create limited edition blueberry dyed blueberry eyes shirts.

All of the dates were amazing, with 10 phenomenal guys! We promised y'all that I would pick one of them to go on a second date with. (Well... its actually a little more than that!❤️ #boyfriend) Today I FINALLY get to reveal to y'all who he is!✅ Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry/Hair Accessories and more... HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) brooklynandbaileyshop.comAs mentioned during the series, we did our best to follow CDC guidelines in mask wearing, hand washing, social distancing, etc, during each of the dates. We crammed in 2-3 dates per day (Hollywood magic), due to my limited schedule. In fact, before each of the dates... the boys had to either take a covid test or confirm that they had been social distancing for 10-14 days, as I did. In fact, we had to replace 2 of the boys who confirmed that they either had covid or were in close contact with someone who had it in the days leading up to our date. It turns out that the GUY I CHOSE ended up being ONE OF THE REPLACEMENTS!!! When the original date canceled due to covid, Betsy Mikesell and Kaitlyn were SCRAMBLING to find a replacement with only days notice. Kaitlyn remembered a cute family she had taken family photos for 3 years ago, and that they had a son who seemed super nice and really handsome. He had since returned from a 2-year LDS mission to Madagascar, and finished his first year at BYU. When she reached out to him via DM about filling in on this date, he finally remembered who she was, listened to the dating series idea, and said YES!❤️ Watch the whole 10 DATES IN 10 DAYS SERIES here!!!  👉🏻 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj0H71LavJZ9_jfT_YnHxeUkn7yvpDecSWhen we went on our date, we had SO MUCH FUN! I didn't want it to end, and we made excuses (intentionally) to extend the date as long as we could despite the day's hectic #dating schedule.This boy was also the first person I texted when I heard from my mom about the Mikesell's plane crash during one of my last dates. (Everyone survived because of miracles, but there were major injuries... https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU) He helped console me, gave me advice on how to manage the rest of the day, helped Betsy coordinate picking me up, and dropped everything to drive to the Mikesell's and help out in any way he could. Those next several days, he would run any errand Betsy and Brock & Boston needed, praying over them, helping clean the house and taking care of the family dog. He had never met the Mikesell's before. Needless to say, I was VERY impressed!In the 6 weeks since, we've texted/FaceTimed every single day. My extended family was dying to know who I had chosen, as did my friends and hundreds of thousands of you! It was hard not share this all with y'all, because we knew we needed to film this video first! He would send me flowers, or often Postmates my favorite foods, etc, all the time. I wanted SO BAD to share this all with you, but knew I couldn't!We knew we wouldn't see each other until the 16th of September, when he planned to fly out for a visit. Little did I know, but, Bailey and my mom had been planning to fly him out early as a SURPRISE for me! I LITERALLY HAD NO IDEA, because he wasn't supposed to show up for three more days! So last Sunday he showed up in Dallas, and Bailey and my mom filmed my reaction. Then we both sat down and filmed a segment to share a little about how we got to where were are! I am SO HAPPY!

It sounds innocuous enough, but a cursory glimpse at any given recipe eschews batter in favor of a sturdier, more reliable flour-and-egg dredge.

The results are annoyingly difficult but undeniably fantastic fried chicken, made in (what I imagine is) the Pollos Hermanos style!Recipe: https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/recipes/pollos-hermanos-breaking-badMusic: “unna” / XXV by Broke for Freehttps://soundcloud.com/broke-for-freeMy playlist of preferred cooking tunes, Bangers with Babish!https://spoti.fi/2TYXmiYBinging With Babish Website: http://bit.ly/BingingBabishWebsiteBasics With Babish Website: http://bit.ly/BasicsWithBabishWebsitePatreon: http://bit.ly/BingingPatreonInstagram: http://bit.ly/BabishInstagramFacebook: http://bit.ly/BabishFacebookTwitter: http://bit.ly/BabishTwitter","PT6M59S"

Watch the trailer for the highly anticipated #DuneMovie now. -----------------https://www.facebook.com/dune https://twitter.com/dunemoviehttps://www.instagram.com/dunemovie-----------------Oscar  nominee  Denis  Villeneuve  (“Arrival,”  “Blade  Runner  2049”)  directs  Warner  Bros.  Pictures  and  Legendary Pictures’ “Dune,” the big-screen adaptation of Frank Herbert’s seminal bestseller of the same name. A mythic and emotionally charged hero’s journey, “Dune” tells the story of Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, who must travel to the most dangerous planet  in  the  universe  to  ensure  the  future  of  his  family  and  his  people.  As  malevolent  forces  explode  into conflict over the planet’s exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence—a commodity capable of unlocking humanity’s greatest potential—only those who can conquer their fear will survive.The film stars Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet (“Call Me by Your Name,”  “Little Women”), Rebecca Ferguson  (“Stephen  King’s  Doctor  Sleep,”   “Mission:  Impossible  –  Fallout”),  Oscar  Isaac  (the “Star  Wars” franchise) Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Milk,” “Avengers: Infinity War”), Stellan Skarsgård (HBO’s “Chernobyl,” “Avengers: Age of Ultron”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Avengers: Endgame”), Stephen McKinley Henderson (“Fences,” “Lady Bird”), Zendaya (“Spider-Man: Homecoming,” HBO’s “Euphoria”), Chang Chen (“Mr.  Long,” “Crouching  Tiger,  Hidden  Dragon”),    David  Dastmalchian  (“Blade  Runner  2049,”  “The  Dark  Knight”), Sharon  Duncan-Brewster  (“Rogue  One:  A  Star  Wars  Story,”  Netflix’s “Sex  Education”),   with  Oscar  nominee Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years,” “Assassin’s Creed”), with Jason Momoa (“Aquaman,” HBO’s “Game of Thrones”), and Oscar winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Skyfall”).   Villeneuve directed “Dune” from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth based on the novel of the same name written by Frank Herbert.  Villeneuve also produced the film with Mary Parent, Cale Boyter  and  Joe  Caracciolo,  Jr.   The  executive  producers  are  Tanya  Lapointe,  Joshua  Grode,  Herbert  W.  Gains, Jon Spaihts, Thomas Tull, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt and Kim Herbert. Behind  the  scenes,  Villeneuve  reteamed  with  two-time  Oscar-nominated  production  designer  Patrice  Vermette  (“Arrival,”  “Sicario,”  “The  Young  Victoria”),  two-time  Oscar-nominated  editor  Joe  Walker  (“Blade  Runner  2049,”  “Arrival,”  “12  Years  a  Slave”),  two-time  Oscar-winning  visual  effects  supervisor  Paul  Lambert  (“First Man,” “Blade Runner 2049”), and Oscar-winning special effects supervisor Gerd Nefzer (“Blade Runner 2049”).    He  also  collaborated  for  the  first  time  with  Oscar-nominated  director  of  photography  Greig  Fraser  (“Lion,”  “Zero  Dark  Thirty,”  “Rogue  One:  A  Star  Wars  Story”);  three-time  Oscar-nominated  costume  designer  Jacqueline West (“The Revenant,” “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” “Quills”) and co-costume designer Bob Morgan; and stunt coordinator Tom Struthers (“The Dark Knight” trilogy, “Inception”).  Oscar-winning and multiple  Oscar-nominated  composer  Hans  Zimmer  (“Blade  Runner  2049,”  “Inception,”  “Gladiator,”  “The  Lion King”) is creating the score.  Warner  Bros.  Pictures  and  Legendary  Pictures  Present  “Dune.”    The  film  is  slated  to  be  released  in  theaters on December 18, 2020.","PT3M5S"

I'm so happy to be able to work with my friend again. We wanted to make a unique and fun DIY craft that we've never seen being done on youtube before. Much like Squishy Makeovers, this diy project transforms squishmallows into custom dolls. This is the first custom doll plushies I've ever made and they are ooak! I used Tulip fabric paints, acrylic paints, solarcolordust airbrush, and felt...and of course SPRINKLES. @Moriah Elizabeth and I were supposed to have a fun in-person collaboration this summer, but with everything going on, we decided to do this fun idea instead. We went with the idea that we would make one plushie in the style of the other (I would make one sweet and 2 darkness creatures), and she would make (1 darkness, and 2 sweetness). I'm so happy to have creative friends in our community.💜💛 Want to support future projects on my channel?
