Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.Sept. 21, 2020 | Stephen Thompson -- We've been trying to make a BTS Tiny Desk concert happen for years now — even gaming out ways we might move Bob Boilen's desk far enough forward to accommodate the superstar Korean boy band's dance moves.In the end, it took a global pandemic — and the launch of Tiny Desk (home) concerts back in March — to make something happen. With BTS cooped up in Seoul, the group held true to the series's spirit by convening a live band for its Tiny Desk debut, and even arranged to perform in a workspace with a music-friendly backdrop: the record store VINYL & PLASTIC by Hyundai Card in BTS's hometown.Opening with this summer's inescapable Dynamite — the group's first single to hit No. 1 in the U.S., as well as its first song to be fully recorded in English — BTS leaned hard into the new track's celebratory, Uptown Funk-adjacent vibes. From there, the group dipped into its back catalog, seizing on the opportunity to showcase its quieter side while (mostly) staying uncharacteristically seated. The breezily propulsive Save ME, from 2016, ultimately gave way to a full-on power ballad in 2017's reflective Spring Day.The latter track seemed especially true to BTS's hopeful nature: Introduced with a few optimistic words from rapper and singer RM (It's been the roughest summer ever, but we know that spring will come), the song reflects on a need to wait out hard times, even as the weight of present-day pain feels oppressive.BTS had intended to spend 2020 delighting the BTS Army in arenas around the world, only to spend these last few months performing in isolation. Released on the last day of a grim season, Spring Day provides a nice reminder of what awaits us on the other side. We just have to get through fall and winter first.SET LISTDynamiteSave MESpring DayMUSICIANSV: vocals; Jin: vocals; Jimin: vocals; J-Hope: vocals; RM: vocals; SUGA: vocals; Jungkook: vocals; KHAN: drums; DOCSKIM: keyboard; Kim Kiwook: bass; Shyun: guitarCREDITSVideo and Audio by: Big Hit Entertainment; Producer: Stephen Thompson; Audio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Video Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann","PT14M7S"

Today we mourn, but with confidence that future generations will remember Ruth Bader Ginsburg as we knew her — a tireless and resolute champion of justice,” Roberts said in a statement.Ginsburg had announced in July that she was undergoing chemotherapy treatment for lesions on her liver, the latest of her several battles with cancer.Born Joan Ruth Bader on March 15, 1933 in Brooklyn, New York, she was the youngest of two children to Nathan and Celia Bader. It was when Ginsburg was in kindergarten that she decided to go by her middle name Ruth, according to Encyclopedia Britannica.Ginsburg grew up in a low-income, working-class neighborhood of Brooklyn, where her father worked as a merchant and her mother worked at a clothing factory. Her older sister, Marilyn, died of meningitis when Ginsburg was only a baby.  Watch what’s happening right NOW from FOX.

It just keeps giving us more. That more came from Cardi B calling it quits in her marriage with Offset, citing cheating as the reason. She is seeking sole custody of their daughter, Kulture. The hearing is set for November 4th. To many it was a surprise but Cardi has been hinting at the split the past few months. Individually, they are both accomplished artists in hip hop, making the two a power couple. Cardi B and Offset’s romance began back in 2017. They collaborated on Cardi B’s song Lick before making it official on Instagram. They moved very fast and were married secretly by September of that year. Soon there was trouble in paradise as Offset was accused of cheating. A video made rounds on social media and Cardi confirmed the rumours herself in an interview with Cosmopolitan. She forgave him but the rumours didn’t stop. Up until her filing for divorce, there was always speculation. Ultimately, infidelity was the reason Cardi filed for divorce. As we wait for the court hearing, let us know your opinions about their relationship. Do you think they will stay separated this time? Will Cardi be able to get sole custody?

All of the dates were amazing, with 10 phenomenal guys! We promised y'all that I would pick one of them to go on a second date with. (Well... its actually a little more than that!❤️ #boyfriend) Today I FINALLY get to reveal to y'all who he is!✅ Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry/Hair Accessories and more... HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) brooklynandbaileyshop.comAs mentioned during the series, we did our best to follow CDC guidelines in mask wearing, hand washing, social distancing, etc, during each of the dates. We crammed in 2-3 dates per day (Hollywood magic), due to my limited schedule. In fact, before each of the dates... the boys had to either take a covid test or confirm that they had been social distancing for 10-14 days, as I did. In fact, we had to replace 2 of the boys who confirmed that they either had covid or were in close contact with someone who had it in the days leading up to our date. It turns out that the GUY I CHOSE ended up being ONE OF THE REPLACEMENTS!!! When the original date canceled due to covid, Betsy Mikesell and Kaitlyn were SCRAMBLING to find a replacement with only days notice. Kaitlyn remembered a cute family she had taken family photos for 3 years ago, and that they had a son who seemed super nice and really handsome. He had since returned from a 2-year LDS mission to Madagascar, and finished his first year at BYU. When she reached out to him via DM about filling in on this date, he finally remembered who she was, listened to the dating series idea, and said YES!❤️ Watch the whole 10 DATES IN 10 DAYS SERIES here!!!  👉🏻 https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj0H71LavJZ9_jfT_YnHxeUkn7yvpDecSWhen we went on our date, we had SO MUCH FUN! I didn't want it to end, and we made excuses (intentionally) to extend the date as long as we could despite the day's hectic #dating schedule.This boy was also the first person I texted when I heard from my mom about the Mikesell's plane crash during one of my last dates. (Everyone survived because of miracles, but there were major injuries... https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU) He helped console me, gave me advice on how to manage the rest of the day, helped Betsy coordinate picking me up, and dropped everything to drive to the Mikesell's and help out in any way he could. Those next several days, he would run any errand Betsy and Brock & Boston needed, praying over them, helping clean the house and taking care of the family dog. He had never met the Mikesell's before. Needless to say, I was VERY impressed!In the 6 weeks since, we've texted/FaceTimed every single day. My extended family was dying to know who I had chosen, as did my friends and hundreds of thousands of you! It was hard not share this all with y'all, because we knew we needed to film this video first! He would send me flowers, or often Postmates my favorite foods, etc, all the time. I wanted SO BAD to share this all with you, but knew I couldn't!We knew we wouldn't see each other until the 16th of September, when he planned to fly out for a visit. Little did I know, but, Bailey and my mom had been planning to fly him out early as a SURPRISE for me! I LITERALLY HAD NO IDEA, because he wasn't supposed to show up for three more days! So last Sunday he showed up in Dallas, and Bailey and my mom filmed my reaction. Then we both sat down and filmed a segment to share a little about how we got to where were are! I am SO HAPPY! What was your reaction when you found out who I chose? What was your favorite part of the video?
