With BTS cooped up in Seoul, the group held true to the series's spirit by convening a live band for its Tiny Desk debut, and even arranged to perform in a workspace with a music-friendly backdrop: the record store VINYL & PLASTIC by Hyundai Card in BTS's hometown.Opening with this summer's inescapable Dynamite ‚Äî the group's first single to hit No. 1 in the U.S., as well as its first song to be fully recorded in English ‚Äî BTS leaned hard into the new track's celebratory, Uptown Funk-adjacent vibes. From there, the group dipped into its back catalog, seizing on the opportunity to showcase its quieter side while (mostly) staying uncharacteristically seated. The breezily propulsive Save ME, from 2016, ultimately gave way to a full-on power ballad in 2017's reflective Spring Day.The latter track seemed especially true to BTS's hopeful nature: Introduced with a few optimistic words from rapper and singer RM (It's been the roughest summer ever, but we know that spring will come), the song reflects on a need to wait out hard times, even as the weight of present-day pain feels oppressive.BTS had intended to spend 2020 delighting the BTS Army in arenas around the world, only to spend these last few months performing in isolation. Released on the last day of a grim season, Spring Day provides a nice reminder of what awaits us on the other side. We just have to get through fall and winter first.SET LISTDynamiteSave MESpring DayMUSICIANSV: vocals; Jin: vocals; Jimin: vocals; J-Hope: vocals; RM: vocals; SUGA: vocals; Jungkook: vocals; KHAN: drums; DOCSKIM: keyboard; Kim Kiwook: bass; Shyun: guitarCREDITSVideo and Audio by: Big Hit Entertainment; Producer: Stephen Thompson; Audio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Video Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya GrundmannABOUT THE SERIESThe Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future.

Dan takes a look back at the incredible ride by Tadej Pogacar that saw him seize the yellow jersey on the slopes of Blanche des Belles Filles and in doing so, defeat his fellow countryman Roglic, who had looked imperial at the helm of one of the strongest cycling teams ever. We also wrap up the Giro Rosa, which also had a surprise winner, a trio of Italian one day races and look ahead to the upcoming cyclocross season.

From Hop to Bellyflop, this is Starship Serial Number 8 which is well underway and we hope only weeks away from a flight test just above 18 kilometers in altitude. Mix that with the many starship prototypes in development and the rapid evolution of the construction and launch sites at Boca Chica and we have loads to catch up on. And along with that, we have some interesting updates on the human landing system by Dynetics and some updates on Astra‚Äôs launch failure from Alaska.SUPPORT ME ON PATREON - https://www.patreon.com/marcushouseJOIN MY DISCORD - https://discord.gg/dAMmbqjFOLLOW ON TWITTER - https://twitter.com/MarcusHouseGameThanks to the production crew:  Brenton Myers,  Brendan Lewis,  GameplayReviewUKA HUGE THANK YOU TO---------------------------------------Neopork (graphics/animations and thumbnail)https://twitter.com/Neopork85https://www.patreon.com/NeoporkGameplayReviewUK - Starships SN5 and SN6 Recreated in Kerbal Space Programhttps://youtu.be/bVkq3isEHmANASASpaceFlight - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSUu1lih2RifWkKtDOJdsBABocaChicaGal - https://twitter.com/BocaChicaGalRGVAerialPhotographyhttps://www.patreon.com/RGVaerialhttps://www.youtube.com/c/RGVAerialPhotographyLab Padrehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFwMITSkc1Fms6PoJoh1OUQMUSICDeliberate Thought by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)Source: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/?keywords=deliberate+thoughtArtist: http://incompetech.com/","PT18M19S"

I wanted it to feel as if Disney magically made a baby with Wes Anderson in the world of Colour Vision with every bit of our souls intertwined. Emily is my actual wife and she is really pregnant right now with our first child, so art imitates life in a fun way with this video. We studied and memorized all of the Korean lyrics to Suga‚Äôs incredible and romantic verse and all of the blueberries in the bathtub ended up being reused to create limited edition blueberry dyed blueberry eyes shirts. This video is a piece of our hearts and I hope it sparks the same magic in you viewing it as it did for us creating it. Thank you to Suga for being so brilliant on this song and more importantly for being a wonderful friend.

All of the dates were amazing, with 10 phenomenal guys! We promised y'all that I would pick one of them to go on a second date with. (Well... its actually a little more than that!‚ù§Ô∏è #boyfriend) Today I FINALLY get to reveal to y'all who he is!‚úÖ Shop our NEW collection of Activewear, Loungewear, Joggers, Mascara, Jewelry/Hair Accessories and more... HERE! (IT SELLS SO FAST!) brooklynandbaileyshop.comAs mentioned during the series, we did our best to follow CDC guidelines in mask wearing, hand washing, social distancing, etc, during each of the dates. We crammed in 2-3 dates per day (Hollywood magic), due to my limited schedule. In fact, before each of the dates... the boys had to either take a covid test or confirm that they had been social distancing for 10-14 days, as I did. In fact, we had to replace 2 of the boys who confirmed that they either had covid or were in close contact with someone who had it in the days leading up to our date. It turns out that the GUY I CHOSE ended up being ONE OF THE REPLACEMENTS!!! When the original date canceled due to covid, Betsy Mikesell and Kaitlyn were SCRAMBLING to find a replacement with only days notice. Kaitlyn remembered a cute family she had taken family photos for 3 years ago, and that they had a son who seemed super nice and really handsome. He had since returned from a 2-year LDS mission to Madagascar, and finished his first year at BYU. When she reached out to him via DM about filling in on this date, he finally remembered who she was, listened to the dating series idea, and said YES!‚ù§Ô∏è Watch the whole 10 DATES IN 10 DAYS SERIES here!!!  üëâüèª https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj0H71LavJZ9_jfT_YnHxeUkn7yvpDecSWhen we went on our date, we had SO MUCH FUN! I didn't want it to end, and we made excuses (intentionally) to extend the date as long as we could despite the day's hectic #dating schedule.This boy was also the first person I texted when I heard from my mom about the Mikesell's plane crash during one of my last dates. (Everyone survived because of miracles, but there were major injuries... https://youtu.be/W_pVekhO-yU) He helped console me, gave me advice on how to manage the rest of the day, helped Betsy coordinate picking me up, and dropped everything to drive to the Mikesell's and help out in any way he could. Those next several days, he would run any errand Betsy and Brock & Boston needed, praying over them, helping clean the house and taking care of the family dog. He had never met the Mikesell's before. Needless to say, I was VERY impressed!In the 6 weeks since, we've texted/FaceTimed every single day. My extended family was dying to know who I had chosen, as did my friends and hundreds of thousands of you! It was hard not share this all with y'all, because we knew we needed to film this video first! He would send me flowers, or often Postmates my favorite foods, etc, all the time. I wanted SO BAD to share this all with you, but knew I couldn't!We knew we wouldn't see each other until the 16th of September, when he planned to fly out for a visit. Little did I know, but, Bailey and my mom had been planning to fly him out early as a SURPRISE for me! I LITERALLY HAD NO IDEA, because he wasn't supposed to show up for three more days! So last Sunday he showed up in Dallas, and Bailey and my mom filmed my reaction. Then we both sat down and filmed a segment to share a little about how we got to where were are! I am SO HAPPY! What was your reaction when you found out who I chose? What was your favorite part of the video?
