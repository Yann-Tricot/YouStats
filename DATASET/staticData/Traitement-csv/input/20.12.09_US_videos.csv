Watch the trailer for the highly anticipated #DuneMovie now. -----------------https://www.facebook.com/dune https://twitter.com/dunemoviehttps://www.instagram.com/dunemovie-----------------Oscar  nominee  Denis  Villeneuve  (“Arrival,”  “Blade  Runner  2049”)  directs  Warner  Bros.  Pictures  and  Legendary Pictures’ “Dune,” the big-screen adaptation of Frank Herbert’s seminal bestseller of the same name. A mythic and emotionally charged hero’s journey, “Dune” tells the story of Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, who must travel to the most dangerous planet  in  the  universe  to  ensure  the  future  of  his  family  and  his  people.  As  malevolent  forces  explode  into conflict over the planet’s exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence—a commodity capable of unlocking humanity’s greatest potential—only those who can conquer their fear will survive.The film stars Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet (“Call Me by Your Name,”  “Little Women”), Rebecca Ferguson  (“Stephen  King’s  Doctor  Sleep,”   “Mission:  Impossible  –  Fallout”),  Oscar  Isaac  (the “Star  Wars” franchise) Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Milk,” “Avengers: Infinity War”), Stellan Skarsgård (HBO’s “Chernobyl,” “Avengers: Age of Ultron”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Avengers: Endgame”), Stephen McKinley Henderson (“Fences,” “Lady Bird”), Zendaya (“Spider-Man: Homecoming,” HBO’s “Euphoria”), Chang Chen (“Mr.  Long,” “Crouching  Tiger,  Hidden  Dragon”),    David  Dastmalchian  (“Blade  Runner  2049,”  “The  Dark  Knight”), Sharon  Duncan-Brewster  (“Rogue  One:  A  Star  Wars  Story,”  Netflix’s “Sex  Education”),   with  Oscar  nominee Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years,” “Assassin’s Creed”), with Jason Momoa (“Aquaman,” HBO’s “Game of Thrones”), and Oscar winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Skyfall”).   Villeneuve directed “Dune” from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth based on the novel of the same name written by Frank Herbert.  Villeneuve also produced the film with Mary Parent, Cale Boyter  and  Joe  Caracciolo,  Jr.   The  executive  producers  are  Tanya  Lapointe,  Joshua  Grode,  Herbert  W.  Gains, Jon Spaihts, Thomas Tull, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt and Kim Herbert. Behind  the  scenes,  Villeneuve  reteamed  with  two-time  Oscar-nominated  production  designer  Patrice  Vermette  (“Arrival,”  “Sicario,”  “The  Young  Victoria”),  two-time  Oscar-nominated  editor  Joe  Walker  (“Blade  Runner  2049,”  “Arrival,”  “12  Years  a  Slave”),  two-time  Oscar-winning  visual  effects  supervisor  Paul  Lambert  (“First Man,” “Blade Runner 2049”), and Oscar-winning special effects supervisor Gerd Nefzer (“Blade Runner 2049”).    He  also  collaborated  for  the  first  time  with  Oscar-nominated  director  of  photography  Greig  Fraser  (“Lion,”  “Zero  Dark  Thirty,”  “Rogue  One:  A  Star  Wars  Story”);  three-time  Oscar-nominated  costume  designer  Jacqueline West (“The Revenant,” “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” “Quills”) and co-costume designer Bob Morgan; and stunt coordinator Tom Struthers (“The Dark Knight” trilogy, “Inception”).  Oscar-winning and multiple  Oscar-nominated  composer  Hans  Zimmer  (“Blade  Runner  2049,”  “Inception,”  “Gladiator,”  “The  Lion King”) is creating the score.  Warner  Bros.  Pictures  and  Legendary  Pictures  Present  “Dune.”    The  film  is  slated  to  be  released  in  theaters on December 18, 2020."

Seventeen-year-old Millie Kessler (Kathryn Newton, Blockers, HBO’s Big Little Lies) is just trying to survive the bloodthirsty halls of Blissfield High and the cruelty of the popular crowd. But when she becomes the newest target of The Butcher (Vince Vaughn), her town’s infamous serial killer, her senior year becomes the least of her worries. When The Butcher’s mystical ancient dagger causes him and Millie to wake up in each other’s bodies, Millie learns that she has just 24 hours to get her body back before the switch becomes permanent and she’s trapped in the form of a middle-aged maniac forever. The only problem is she now looks like a towering psychopath who’s the target of a city-wide manhunt while The Butcher looks like her and has brought his appetite for carnage to Homecoming.With some help from her friends—ultra-woke Nyla (Celeste O’Connor, Ghostbusters: Afterlife), ultra-fabulous Joshua (Misha Osherovich, The Goldfinch) and her crush Booker (Uriah Shelton, Enter the Warriors Gate)—Millie races against the clock to reverse the curse while The Butcher discovers that having a female teen body is the perfect cover for a little Homecoming killing spree. The film also stars Alan Ruck (HBO’s Succession), Katie Finneran (TV’s Why Women Kill) and Dana Drori (Hulu’s High Fidelity). From the deliciously debased mind of writer-director Christopher Landon (Happy Death Day, the Paranormal Activity franchise) comes a pitch-black horror-comedy about a slasher, a senior, and the brutal truth about high school.  Freaky is written by Christopher Landon and Michael Kennedy (Fox’s Bordertown) and is produced by Jason Blum (Halloween, The Invisible Man). The film is produced by Blumhouse Productions in association with Divide/Conquer. The executive producers are Couper Samuelson and Jeanette Volturno."

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.For her Tiny Desk (home) concert, Phoebe Bridgers chose the White House. OK, maybe it's a green screen, but she and her team created a sweet mock-up of the Oval Office, with Phoebe performing behind a very special desk. It's a far cry from the hotel bed in Austin we first filmed Phoebe on back in 2017, but her ambitions and talent run high. She played the Tiny Desk later that year and returned with newfound bandmates, Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker, as boygenius one year later. But there was more to come when she surprised us all for a magical collaboration with her musical hero Conor Oberst as Better Oblivion Community Center just six months later.Phoebe and bandmates Marshall Vore on drums and Harrison Whitford on guitar perform three songs from her brilliant new album, Punisher. They open with Kyoto, a story song based on her first trip to Japan, followed with a sweet version of Moon Song and the sad details of loving someone who doesn't love themself. And then comes the kicker, as Phoebe introduces herself with the words I hope everybody's enjoying their apocalypse, as the band kicks into her surreal doomsday tune I Know the End. And what an end it is: The trio expands to an ensemble and a crowd-sourced chorus of fans — recording from bedrooms, cars, backyards and trampolines — lets out the kind of cathartic scream that has come to define 2020 for so many of us.Phoebe for President, 2020.SET LISTKyotoMoon SongI Know The EndMUSICIANSPhoebe Bridgers: vocals, guitar; Marshall Vore: drums, vocals; Harrison Whitford: guitar; Emily Retsas: bass; Nick White: keyboard; Odessa Jorgensen: violinCREDITSVideo by: Lucas Belkind, Dalton Gaudin, Jason Lester, Powell Robinson; Audio by: Joseph Lorge; Producer: Bob Boilen; Audio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Video Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann"

You can't expect them to understand Star Wars. The higher ups who sign off on such a thing, especially when appointed by George Lucas like KK was, should have put her foot down and really course corrected things.Everything is so messed up, and the final nail is in.I hope things continue under Favreau.

Masks do double-duty, and the fraction of interactions with masks is much higher than the fraction of people wearing masks, so partially adopted, partially effective masks are able to reduce the basic reproduction number surprisingly well.REFERENCES:Aatish’s detailed writeup on github: https://github.com/aatishb/maskmath/blob/master/model/mathmodel.ipynbAmid the Coronavirus Crisis, a Regimen for Re-entry: https://www.newyorker.com/science/medical-dispatch/amid-the-coronavirus-crisis-a-regimen-for-reentryFace Masks Against COVID-19: An Evidence Review https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202004.0203/v3Mask FAQ Test Results: https://www.maskfaq.com/test-resultsThe Effect of Mask Use on the Spread of Influenza During a Pandemic: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1539-6924.2010.01428.xCalibrated Intervention and Containment of the COVID-19 Pandemic: https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2003/2003.07353.pdfCloth Mask Breathability and Filtration Efficiency Technical Report: https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e8126f89327941b9453eeef/t/5f2c4463a5c9f75a38d2b26f/1596736614213/N95DECON_cloth_mask_breathability_filtrationtechnical_report_v1_200804.pdfWhat kind of mask should I be wearing to protect against COVID-19? http://built-envi.com/what-kind-of-mask-should-i-be-wearing-to-protect-against-covid-19/Masks for all?

A super big thanks to David Linderman, Jeremy Fielding, Trent, and David Woodall (the welder).I realize most people who support Smarter Every Day don't do it for transactional reasons, (ie, I'll support Smarter Every Day to get stuff).  I also realized that there is often a mental hurdle that must be crossed before support on Patreon starts.  My thought is that I'd really like to give folks a baseball, and it might provide enough momentum to get over that initial hurdle.  I signed the first shipment of baseballs I received, but I only have so many of those.  There's no implication that my signature is worth anything.... it's just kind of what you do with baseballs... it's a tradition.  After a certain number, it will transition to unsigned baseballs.  I've got enough signed baseballs to over all existing Patrons, and many more, but I will wait a month or so to see how many I need to get, then I'll order the second batch.  I like to support jobs and pay people for what they're good at.  The machinists and welders who made the parts in this video for example.  The whole intent here is to diversify away from solely being ad sponsored so I don't have to answer to anyone but myself and Patrons with respect to the types of content I choose to make.

Apologies for the long absence, but we are trying to get things back on track. No, this video didn’t take us 3 months to make - we filmed a bunch of videos in July and this is the first of them to be released! It’s not a magnum opus, just supposed to be fun and lighthearted. If you want to read more about our plans, you can check out my blog post here:https://www.safiyasnewintrosong.com/single-post/2020/09/04/where-have-we-beenNow, onto the video! A few weeks ago, somewhere deep in a visual ASMR YouTube rabbit hole, I discovered the online acrylic pour art community - where people essentially make interesting color combos of paint in a cup, then pour that cup onto a canvas or object - and then manipulate that object to create truly mesmerizing, rainbow, psychedelic pieces of art. And I was instantly hooked - just something about the way the paints flow from the cup and then slide around the canvas really got me, ya know? So I decided to pick an acrylic pour art video and try to follow it myself, to see if I could do it too. So I chose a pouring guru, Tiktus color art, and got to work.What do you guys think of my ~acrylic pouring adventure~?This video is NOT sponsored!!Safiya's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/Twitter: https://twitter.com/safiyajnFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/safnygaard/The tutorial we followed is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yndPwAMGEggYou can check out Tiktus’s channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeAvBShy5a2_vTFflQG_zWgMUSICVia AudioNetwork"

He is the President of a nonprofit organization called Laughing At My Nightmare, and a renowned public speaker who has performed across the country at places such as Harvard University, The University of Florida, The University of Connecticut, Princeton University, and many more.Hannah Aylward graduated from Carleton College, where she studied Sociology and Anthropology. She films and edits the “Squirmy and Grubs” vlog, which has over 670,000 subscribers on YouTube. Hannah has spoken at prestigious universities and Fortune 500 companies alike about the realities of ableism. On her popular Instagram account, she advocates for acceptance of all people and works to improve the way society thinks about disability.Shane and Hannah have been together for over four years. They got married in September of 2020 in the midst of a global pandemic in their backyard, with their officiant conducting the ceremony via Zoom. Their interabled relationship often confuses people, because much of society still cannot fathom people with disabilities being involved in loving, intimate relationships. Anyone who watches these episodes will quickly see their relationship is just as “normal” as any other. Sure, Hannah helps Shane use the bathroom and brush his teeth, but those activities do not detract from the emotional, intellectual, and physical connection they experience together."

Wakanda ForeverSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Talko-------------------------------------------------------------------------The tragic passing of the beloved actor, Chadwick Boseman has affected everyone. We will remember his role as King T’Challa in Marvel’s Black Panther. We will also remember him as an inspirational person. He was very vocal about his passions. During his last moments, he spent his time at home, with his family and his wife. Unbeknownst to the world, Chadwick had married his finance, Taylor Simone Ledward after a long-lasting relationship. They were both very private people but showed their love for each other publicly. We will never forget the moment Chadwick declared his love for his future wife at the NAACP Awards. We will also never forget the beautiful photos of them smiling on red carpets and sitting courtside at basketball games. Many of their precious moments happened in California, the state is where Simone was born and raised. The couple spent much of their time in Los Angeles, California but Chadwick had also spent time in the U.K, Washington, and Brooklyn. When he settled down in California to pursue his acting career, he found his love, Simone. He started off with biopics of prominent figures and reached superstardom with his role as King T’Challa in Black Panther, with Simone always by his side. Behind all the flashing lights, there was his private life. He had a very loving relationship with Simone. She was with him in his final moments. How will you remember Chadwick Boseman?

But it’s easier to tackle these tasks before the planking goes on, and I’ve had the help of a shipbuilding engineer to work out the best shape and size for these alarming new holes.Also in this episode, I finally make the template for the final shape of the transom, and Pete fairs it into the rest of the hull very nicely - more-or-less completing the tedious but valuable fairing job.
