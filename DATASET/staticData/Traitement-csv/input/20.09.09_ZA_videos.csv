Apologies for the long absence, but we are trying to get things back on track. No, this video didn’t take us 3 months to make - we filmed a bunch of videos in July and this is the first of them to be released! It’s not a magnum opus, just supposed to be fun and lighthearted. If you want to read more about our plans, you can check out my blog post here:https://www.safiyasnewintrosong.com/single-post/2020/09/04/where-have-we-beenNow, onto the video! A few weeks ago, somewhere deep in a visual ASMR YouTube rabbit hole, I discovered the online acrylic pour art community - where people essentially make interesting color combos of paint in a cup, then pour that cup onto a canvas or object - and then manipulate that object to create truly mesmerizing, rainbow, psychedelic pieces of art. And I was instantly hooked - just something about the way the paints flow from the cup and then slide around the canvas really got me, ya know? So I decided to pick an acrylic pour art video and try to follow it myself, to see if I could do it too. So I chose a pouring guru, Tiktus color art, and got to work.What do you guys think of my ~acrylic pouring adventure~?This video is NOT sponsored!!Safiya's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/Twitter: https://twitter.com/safiyajnFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/safnygaard/The tutorial we followed is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yndPwAMGEggYou can check out Tiktus’s channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeAvBShy5a2_vTFflQG_zWgMUSICVia AudioNetwork"

Wakanda ForeverSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Talko-------------------------------------------------------------------------The tragic passing of the beloved actor, Chadwick Boseman has affected everyone. We will remember his role as King T’Challa in Marvel’s Black Panther. We will also remember him as an inspirational person. He was very vocal about his passions. During his last moments, he spent his time at home, with his family and his wife. Unbeknownst to the world, Chadwick had married his finance, Taylor Simone Ledward after a long-lasting relationship. They were both very private people but showed their love for each other publicly. We will never forget the moment Chadwick declared his love for his future wife at the NAACP Awards. We will also never forget the beautiful photos of them smiling on red carpets and sitting courtside at basketball games. Many of their precious moments happened in California, the state is where Simone was born and raised. The couple spent much of their time in Los Angeles, California but Chadwick had also spent time in the U.K, Washington, and Brooklyn. When he settled down in California to pursue his acting career, he found his love, Simone. He started off with biopics of prominent figures and reached superstardom with his role as King T’Challa in Black Panther, with Simone always by his side. Behind all the flashing lights, there was his private life. He had a very loving relationship with Simone. She was with him in his final moments. How will you remember Chadwick Boseman?

If you draw up a map, trace a line connecting the island of Bermuda, Puerto Rico, Miami, and back to Bermuda, what do you get?  Yes, it’s a triangle – a sinister polygon known for mysteriously swallowing over 2,000 ships and 200 aircraft over centuries! And here's a story about the Bermuda Triangle you probably didn’t hear about. So, the airplane involved was a Beechcraft Bonanza single-engine aircraft. Onboard, pilot Bruce Gernon had two passengers: his father and business partner. They took off from Andros Island in the Bahamas and headed northwest for the Florida coast. It was December 4, 1970. This was a typical flight Bruce had made dozens of times before! But this time would be different. They would face really unexplainable and maybe even mysterious things…#brightsidePreview photo credit: Lancaster, USA - March 24, 2018, Beechcraft F33C Bonanza on display during Los Angeles County Air Show at William J.

A super big thanks to David Linderman, Jeremy Fielding, Trent, and David Woodall (the welder).I realize most people who support Smarter Every Day don't do it for transactional reasons, (ie, I'll support Smarter Every Day to get stuff).  I also realized that there is often a mental hurdle that must be crossed before support on Patreon starts.  My thought is that I'd really like to give folks a baseball, and it might provide enough momentum to get over that initial hurdle.  I signed the first shipment of baseballs I received, but I only have so many of those.  There's no implication that my signature is worth anything.... it's just kind of what you do with baseballs... it's a tradition.  After a certain number, it will transition to unsigned baseballs.  I've got enough signed baseballs to over all existing Patrons, and many more, but I will wait a month or so to see how many I need to get, then I'll order the second batch.  I like to support jobs and pay people for what they're good at.  The machinists and welders who made the parts in this video for example.  The whole intent here is to diversify away from solely being ad sponsored so I don't have to answer to anyone but myself and Patrons with respect to the types of content I choose to make.

Going flat out we have everything from the Chiron to LaFerrari, and One:1 to Zonda Cinque, mixed in with the Carrera GT, GFG Style 2030, Veyron Vitesse, and of course the likes of the Regera flat out. Obviously the loudest of the bunch is the Lamborghini Aventador SVJ, trying its luck against a Bugatti Chiron!In attendance at SOC with two of the Shmeemobiles, the McLaren Senna and Mercedes SLS AMG Black Series, it is of course a must that we put the two up against one another to show the difference between a 'fast car' and a 'really fast car'. Giving the SLS BS a small head start, being piloted by @benzeneben, the 800hp of the Senna ultimately causes an obliteration as it flies by on the way to 270km/h (168mph).

In many cases the drivers are learning their cars or doing a launch for the first time, these are privately owned vehicles to the most part and it's absolutely fantastic to see so many owners being happy to use their vehicles and for them to be shared with the audience!Thanks for watching, TimSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Shmee150YTWebsite: http://www.shmee150.comShop: http://shop.shmee150.comInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/shmee150Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/shmee150"

The concept was simple — gather a bunch of living, breathing bodies in the same place at the same time and just see what happens. And if my friends wanted me to be on time to a party, they’d lie.I wasn’t proud of my reputation with time. Once, someone was describing their color blindness to me and it reminded me a lot of how I feel about time. How I know that 3 pm and 3:05 pm are technically different, but I personally don’t perceive that contrast.I tried my best to banish those thoughts. I bought clocks and set them to five minutes early. And I was finally closing the gap — becoming one of those people who holds the reins of time. And then — the pandemic happened.And suddenly Tuesdays were Thursdays were Sundays. The whole world joined me in temporal disorientation — even my punctual superiors were at a loss. They knew how to arrive five minutes early — not how to repeat the same five minutes 43,854 times.Maybe we’ve all been too fixated on keeping track of time when what we need most is vocabulary to describe the new colors of time.We were thrilled to work with filmmaker Sindha Agha on this video.

In this sighting, a sneaky hyena tried its luck and almost scared a leopard out of its wits!BOOK YOUR TRIP TO KRUGER: http://bit.ly/BookatKruger33-year-old field guide, Jason Joubert told LatestSightings.com about this comical sighting:Send in your wildlife video here, and earn money: https://www.latestsightings.com/partnership“My guests and I left for a morning game drive in the Western Sabi Sands on Christmas morning. We were not even 100m from the lodge when we came across a male leopard sleeping in a miter drain. I stopped at the sighting. We stopped, sat and watched for about 5 minutes while the guests had their cameras out to capture the sighting for their souvenirs.”“As we watched the leopard wake up and groom, we noticed a male hyena walking down the road in our direction. (I assume he was following the leopards' scent). We watched and waited as the hyena carefully approached the leopard, taking a step closer and closer each time and the leopard seemingly oblivious of its sniffing visitor while it groomed its paws. We did not expect the hyena to walk straight up to the leopard and we thought that the leopard would have sensed the hyena right away, but this was not the case.”“The leopard slowly got up, almost still in a sleepy daze, and realized with a jolt that the hyena was now almost face to face! It jolted up in defense and jumped back, snarling and growling, warning the hyena to keep a distance.”“This was a comical scene, everyone on the vehicle had a good chuckle. After a few seconds, the hyena carried on walking off as there was no reason for him to hang around any longer, there was no potential meal to scavenge for, and so the leopard went back to grooming.”“We are lucky enough to witness hyena and leopard interaction quite often, but never quite like this! Once you get to a sighting and you do start filming, make sure to film longer!”To license the footage: Contact@LatestSightings.comGet some of our exclusive specials at the Kruger National Park (Free nights): https://www.latestsightings.com/specialsSnapchat: LatestSightingsTwitter & Instagram: @LatestKrugerFor live wildlife sightings in the Kruger National Park: http://www.latestsightings.com/And like our Facebook page for great sightings and photos: https://www.facebook.com/latestsightingskrugerSubscribe to us on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/LatestSightings"

Today, we had the special opportunity to eat at Goyae Jaogao Restaurant (ร้านก๊ะเหย๊าะ เจ้าเก่า), a restaurant known locally for its goat curry, beef curry, and cow hoof soup - made in an extreme way. #streetfood #ThaiFood #ThailandWe arrived at 8 am in the morning to watch Aunty as she started cooking. I loved everything about the restaurant and her style as soon as she arrived. You’ll notice there’s not just one giant jacuzzi of boiling curry, not two, but 6 in the front, all bubbling away - with another in the back. The day we went she cooked an entire goat of curry, plus 50 kilos of cow hoofs, another huge amount of beef curry, and finally one of her specialities - beef bone soup with chamuang leaves, or garcinia cowa leaves.My favorite styles, the best part of her cooking was when she tied the lemongrass like a rope and crumpled the garcinia cowa leaves and chucked them into the massive posts of bubbling curry. Amazing!We ordered and ate everything she has on her menu, and honestly I would recommend everything, it was that good:Beef curry (แกงเผ็ดเนื้อ)Goat curry (แกงแพะ)Cow foot soup (ช่อมาลี)Bone soup (ซุปกระดูก)Organ soup (ซุปเครื่องใน)Omelet (ไข่เจียว)Total price - 600 THB ($19.12) for everythingShe makes some of the best beef soup that I’ve ever had in Thailand, maybe the world, and the cow hoof soup was extraordinary. Both curries were also fantastic.

Always a pioneer of technology, luxury and safety, the latest generation moves the game on to new levels. Let's take a first look walkaround at the new model and in particular the S500 Long Wheelbase AMG Line, to discover all about it in detail inside and out.The S Class is the flagship Mercedes model and has long been established as the car that's used to introduce new features that will go on to trickle down through the line. The arrival of an entirely new model is a always a game changer and the newest iteration is absolutely no different; from the systems for user interaction to the driving dynamics and of course safety systems incorporated into it.For the launch and a first look in detail, we can explore two S500 Long Wheelbase models, one in Diamond White with the AMG Line package, and the other in High-Tech Silver. From touring around the exterior, to running through the new MBUX infotainment system and experiencing the luxury of the rear, there's a lot to take in.The list of technology is almost endless but let's discover about the new MBUX with gaze and gesture control, a 3D dashboard and augmented reality for the heads up display. It features E-Active Body Control, and offers rear wheel steering with up to 10 degrees of steering to enable a turning radius of just 2 metres. The headlights are the new Digital Light system that projects 1.3m pixels and could even technically present a video! There are more things to take in though including the new key, the extending door handles, the screens and controls themselves and so much more and this is just touching on the surface.Thanks for watching, TimSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Shmee150YTWebsite: http://www.shmee150.comShop: http://shop.shmee150.comInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/shmee150Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/shmee150"

The actor, who was famous for playing T'Challa, the MCU's Black Panther and King of Wakanda, was easily one of the greatest and most influential stars of our time. Boseman passed away after a four-year-long battle with colon cancer. In fact, he was fighting the disease throughout the four years he made his last seven movies.When Boseman's official Twitter account broke the tragic news, the world was in shock. The outpouring of love from the actor's fans and fellow celebrities was immediate and heartfelt. People paid their respects and fondly remembered his many great roles, as well as the way his role as T'Challa proved that representation matters.Apart from the vast human and cultural tragedy of Boseman's death, it also created a difficult problem for Disney and its subsidiary Marvel Studios. Black Panther is already a billion-dollar cinematic entity, and Boseman would arguably have been the most beloved and bankable star of the next few phases of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With the actor's popularity and the character's in-universe role as an intelligent superhero with access to amazing technology, Boseman's T'Challa was essentially the current MCU's answer to former franchise lynchpin Tony Stark.So, how is Disney dealing with this difficult and heartbreaking situation? Disney representatives say they're not focused on figuring out what to do with Black Panther 2, at least, not quite yet.According to The Hollywood Reporter, sources within the Disney corporation have stated that the company is, quote, processing the grief of a loved one, and paying homage to Boseman. As such, they have no immediate plans to shift focus to the Black Panther sequel, and aren't offering up any details about what such a sequel would even look like, as of the making of this video.Boseman wanted to keep his illness as private as possible. As such, only a few people outside his family knew about his cancer diagnosis and subsequent battle at all. The MCU at large, in fact, was so deeply in the dark about Boseman's situation that the news only reached Marvel head honcho Kevin Feige's inbox on the day the Black Panther actor died.As such, the MCU's reaction to Boseman's death was that of stunned heartbreak, followed by touching memories of their beloved co-star and friend. Robert Downey Jr. even called Boseman and his achievements the high point of the entire MCU.The Iron Man star elaborated to Good Morning America,It was the one where people got to vote with their ticket sales and say: 'We require this overdue diversity.'At some point Disney and Marvel executives will have to lift the veil of sorrow and ask themselves the difficult question: How should things go forward without Boseman?Disney has faced this uniquely tragic situation before, unfortunately. In 2016, the company had to figure out how to proceed with The Rise of Skywalker when the esteemed Carrie Fisher, who played Princess Leia, died at 60. In the same vein, Universal had to painstakingly recreate Paul Walker when the actor passed away in a car accident as shooting Fast & Furious 7 was taking place.However, Boseman was the star of his own, incredibly successful movie, and he was a major player in the notoriously interconnected MCU in general. While Disney could cancel Black Panther 2 and quietly write T'Challa out of the MCU, seeing as the first movie was a cultural, critical, and financial success and that Boseman's death will have to be addressed in some fashion, some believe that's an unlikely outcome. Other observers think that the company could try to replace Boseman with another actor, but that's bound to cause a massive outcry, and for good reason.Knowing this, many think that a better option might be to take a page from the comic books and hand the Black Panther mantle to Shuri, T'Challa's younger sister, played by Letitia Wright. The tenacious and tech-savvy Shuri is a popular character, and her ascension to full Black Panther-hood is already something fans want to see in Black Panther 2. This idea has even pushed some fans to start petitioning for Disney and Marvel to tap Shuri to become the next Black Panther.Regardless of what's going to happen, the MCU, and the world, has lost a true giant in Chadwick Boseman. As Black Panther director Ryan Coogler put it:I spent the last year preparing, imagining and writing words for him to say that we weren't destined to see. It leaves me broken knowing that I won't be able to watch another close-up of him in the monitor again or walk up to him and ask for another take.Our thoughts are with Boseman's friends and family during this time of grief.#ChadwickBoseman #RIPChadwickBoseman #BlackPantherRead the full article here: https://www.looper.com/243643/disneys-main-priority-revealed-after-chadwick-bosemans-tragic-death/"

The Black Panther star had essentially battled his illness in secret, so colleagues and fans were shocked to hear the heartbreaking news. His death has prompted an outpouring of support, with everyone from co-star and Oscar-winner Viola Davis to former President Barack Obama expressing condolences to his family and recalling memories with the powerful actor.Boseman became a global superstar and inspiration to millions while also remaining a very private person. He was reportedly dating singer Taylor Simone Ledward for years, but his relationship was only confirmed when her grandmother spoke to InTouch magazine in 2018. In a statement released by his representatives this weekend, fans also learned for the first time that Boseman and Ledward had gotten married. Here's what we know about Boseman's relationship.Boseman and Ledward were first spotted together in 2015, according to Page Six. Boseman had often referred to a lady in his life but the general public didn't know much about this mystery woman. His first headline-making sighting with Ledward happened in 2015 at the Los Angeles International Airport, according to E! News, but while the press wanted to know more, the star preferred to keep his private life under wraps. Some had speculated that Boseman was dating Black Panther co-star Lupito Nyong'o, but a since-deleted Instagram post by someone who is reported to be Taylor Simone Ledward's sister attempted to put that rumor to rest, according to gossip site The Young, Black, and Fabulous. The post from March 2018 read, [Chadwick's] real life queen is gorgeous, and together they embody true love. Not to mention they would make some beautiful babies.Ledward is a 2014 graduate of Cal Polytechnic University Pomona, where she majored in music industry studies and performed as lead singer of a jazz band. There was reportedly about a 14-year age difference between Ledward and Boseman.When Ledward's grandmother confirmed the relationship in 2018, she told InTouch, quote, She's very happy, and he is, too, noting that her granddaughter and Boseman respect each other. Ledward accompanied the actor to numerous red carpet events over the years, including the 2019 Screen Actors Guild Awards, where the stars of Black Panther won the award for outstanding performance by a cast in a motion picture. The couple was also photographed hand in hand during a 21 Bridges screening in New York in 2019. Finally, in March 2019, Boseman acknowledged his relationship with Ledward in a very public way.While receiving the award for outstanding actor in a motion picture at the NAACP Image Awards for his performance in Black Panther, Boseman kissed Ledward before getting on stage and said a few words about her importance in his life. He said while accepting the award,Simone, you're with me every day. I have to acknowledge you right now. Love you. In a clip from the NAACP Image Awards ceremony, you can see Ledward mouth I love you back to Boseman after his remarks. According to MediaTakeOut, Boseman and Ledward got engaged in October 2019, after about four years of dating. Boseman was reportedly planning to propose in 2020 but just couldn't wait to pop the question, and got down on one knee on a date night in Malibu. After that, the star and his partner made more public appearances together, and Ledward appeared to be wearing a ring on numerous occasions. One of their last documented high-profile appearances together was sitting courtside at the NBA All-Star Game in February 2020.They are thought to have married in private in the months prior to Boseman's death, according to the Daily Mail. Per a statement released following Boseman's passing, Ledward and the rest of the actor's loved ones are mourning in private at this time. The statement read, in part,The family thanks you for your love and prayers and asks that you continue to respect their privacy during this difficult time. Our thoughts are with all those grieving Boseman's passing.#ChadwickBosemanRead full article: https://www.nickiswift.com/241518/chadwick-bosemans-family-revealed-that-he-got-married-before-his-death/"
