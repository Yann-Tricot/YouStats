This is a lot like squishy makeovers, but with plushies instead!Since this has never been done before, we are having to get very experimental. I ended up using a combination of techniques and materials to give my plushie a makeover. I will be doing some basic sewing, gluing, using felt, ribbon, and lots of fabric paint as usual! We decided to us Squishmallows to customize since they are so simple and really cute.

As I currently don't know what to restore next, I decided to make the 8 ball. It was a very cool little project. Very accurate work was needed to get all six individual pieces fit together with no gaps. The hardest part of this project was filming the last few shots, because it is so super shiny now and reflects everything. I really like how it turned out and it will be a nice decoration piece to look at.I hope you like my work and the video.Huge thank you to all of my Patreon and PayPal supporters and specially to:Adel AlSaffarGregoryAlex McGeorgeAlistair MoorAmar.kCourtney MaleportDavid BarkerDiecast PirateGreg MarstonLambda GPU WorkstationsMatt BoschMellissa MarcusMuzaffer AksoyPaul MampillyVickie BlighVince ValentiXavier CarbelYale BakerYuri ZapuchlakAlex Bretonalex latzkoAlex ShipleyAllen FrankAmanda Taylor, EsqAndreas MimraAndrew PhillipsAnthony AdamsArni Bjorgvinssonaudi4444playerBlake TBrian NewtonCarloChad BryantChris SimondetEasy GreenGrok SenftenHarper KimHunter R.Jeremy ColeJessica AlexanderJonas RichartzJordan PageJozette Sotojustin f.Kelly ImgrundLVEMarc CerisierMartin Rønnow KlarlundMellissa McConnellMichael BierMickey EisenhornMike DonaldsonNick CannonPasacal SchmikalPaul AmbryPerryKScott MarshallStuart MitchellSuirosThe CarlsonsTodd MedburyTrevor KamWarren G Strand JrXL S웅록 윤Time and costs of this project:$25 materialI was working on this project for 4 daysIf you have any questions about the process, machines i'm using or other stuff, just ask me in the comments.

Seventeen-year-old Millie Kessler (Kathryn Newton, Blockers, HBO’s Big Little Lies) is just trying to survive the bloodthirsty halls of Blissfield High and the cruelty of the popular crowd. But when she becomes the newest target of The Butcher (Vince Vaughn), her town’s infamous serial killer, her senior year becomes the least of her worries. When The Butcher’s mystical ancient dagger causes him and Millie to wake up in each other’s bodies, Millie learns that she has just 24 hours to get her body back before the switch becomes permanent and she’s trapped in the form of a middle-aged maniac forever. The only problem is she now looks like a towering psychopath who’s the target of a city-wide manhunt while The Butcher looks like her and has brought his appetite for carnage to Homecoming.With some help from her friends—ultra-woke Nyla (Celeste O’Connor, Ghostbusters: Afterlife), ultra-fabulous Joshua (Misha Osherovich, The Goldfinch) and her crush Booker (Uriah Shelton, Enter the Warriors Gate)—Millie races against the clock to reverse the curse while The Butcher discovers that having a female teen body is the perfect cover for a little Homecoming killing spree. The film also stars Alan Ruck (HBO’s Succession), Katie Finneran (TV’s Why Women Kill) and Dana Drori (Hulu’s High Fidelity). From the deliciously debased mind of writer-director Christopher Landon (Happy Death Day, the Paranormal Activity franchise) comes a pitch-black horror-comedy about a slasher, a senior, and the brutal truth about high school.  Freaky is written by Christopher Landon and Michael Kennedy (Fox’s Bordertown) and is produced by Jason Blum (Halloween, The Invisible Man). The film is produced by Blumhouse Productions in association with Divide/Conquer. The executive producers are Couper Samuelson and Jeanette Volturno."

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.For her Tiny Desk (home) concert, Phoebe Bridgers chose the White House. OK, maybe it's a green screen, but she and her team created a sweet mock-up of the Oval Office, with Phoebe performing behind a very special desk. It's a far cry from the hotel bed in Austin we first filmed Phoebe on back in 2017, but her ambitions and talent run high. She played the Tiny Desk later that year and returned with newfound bandmates, Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker, as boygenius one year later. But there was more to come when she surprised us all for a magical collaboration with her musical hero Conor Oberst as Better Oblivion Community Center just six months later.Phoebe and bandmates Marshall Vore on drums and Harrison Whitford on guitar perform three songs from her brilliant new album, Punisher. They open with Kyoto, a story song based on her first trip to Japan, followed with a sweet version of Moon Song and the sad details of loving someone who doesn't love themself. And then comes the kicker, as Phoebe introduces herself with the words I hope everybody's enjoying their apocalypse, as the band kicks into her surreal doomsday tune I Know the End. And what an end it is: The trio expands to an ensemble and a crowd-sourced chorus of fans — recording from bedrooms, cars, backyards and trampolines — lets out the kind of cathartic scream that has come to define 2020 for so many of us.Phoebe for President, 2020.SET LISTKyotoMoon SongI Know The EndMUSICIANSPhoebe Bridgers: vocals, guitar; Marshall Vore: drums, vocals; Harrison Whitford: guitar; Emily Retsas: bass; Nick White: keyboard; Odessa Jorgensen: violinCREDITSVideo by: Lucas Belkind, Dalton Gaudin, Jason Lester, Powell Robinson; Audio by: Joseph Lorge; Producer: Bob Boilen; Audio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Video Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann"

No, it was not.The utter lack of care and direction regarding the sequel trilogy has me beyond bothered. I found it hard to find my words in this first time reaction and realization that we've really truly been all lied to regarding everything.The Mandalorian is all I have to look forward to.With Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni behind Star Wars, there is hope. As far as the sequels go, they're no longer in my timeline of Star Wars canon.I don't think the actors should ever be to blame. Neither should the writers and directors. You can't expect them to understand Star Wars. The higher ups who sign off on such a thing, especially when appointed by George Lucas like KK was, should have put her foot down and really course corrected things.Everything is so messed up, and the final nail is in.I hope things continue under Favreau.

That is a really good point and something that I can't let stand. In this video I show you how I devoted several weeks of my life to realizing a basketball hoop that makes your shot go in even if you totally miss the hoop.... it was a lot of fun, and quite a bit more challenging than I was anticipating. Hopefully you enjoy it :)Although very fun, these videos are very time consuming and expensive. Please consider helping to support the development of these projects through my patreon at http://patreon.com/stuffmadehereI built this with the new Tormach 24r check it out: https://hubs.ly/H0rSZY60Top CommentThis project was really hard. It was a huge challenge to whittle the 450gigs of footage down into a video that shared my journey of designing and getting this machine working. I hope you enjoyed it :) If you are interested in helping to support me making more of these videos you can check out my Patreon at http://patreon.com/stuffmadehere. One question - would a podcast be interesting yes / no? I've been considering that as an opportunity to share more details and whatnot that can't make it into my videos."

For 2021 he replaces Sergio Perez, and will slot in alongside Lance Stroll.

A super big thanks to David Linderman, Jeremy Fielding, Trent, and David Woodall (the welder).I realize most people who support Smarter Every Day don't do it for transactional reasons, (ie, I'll support Smarter Every Day to get stuff).  I also realized that there is often a mental hurdle that must be crossed before support on Patreon starts.  My thought is that I'd really like to give folks a baseball, and it might provide enough momentum to get over that initial hurdle.  I signed the first shipment of baseballs I received, but I only have so many of those.  There's no implication that my signature is worth anything.... it's just kind of what you do with baseballs... it's a tradition.  After a certain number, it will transition to unsigned baseballs.  I've got enough signed baseballs to over all existing Patrons, and many more, but I will wait a month or so to see how many I need to get, then I'll order the second batch.  I like to support jobs and pay people for what they're good at.  The machinists and welders who made the parts in this video for example.  The whole intent here is to diversify away from solely being ad sponsored so I don't have to answer to anyone but myself and Patrons with respect to the types of content I choose to make.

Apologies for the long absence, but we are trying to get things back on track. No, this video didn’t take us 3 months to make - we filmed a bunch of videos in July and this is the first of them to be released! It’s not a magnum opus, just supposed to be fun and lighthearted. If you want to read more about our plans, you can check out my blog post here:https://www.safiyasnewintrosong.com/single-post/2020/09/04/where-have-we-beenNow, onto the video! A few weeks ago, somewhere deep in a visual ASMR YouTube rabbit hole, I discovered the online acrylic pour art community - where people essentially make interesting color combos of paint in a cup, then pour that cup onto a canvas or object - and then manipulate that object to create truly mesmerizing, rainbow, psychedelic pieces of art. And I was instantly hooked - just something about the way the paints flow from the cup and then slide around the canvas really got me, ya know? So I decided to pick an acrylic pour art video and try to follow it myself, to see if I could do it too. So I chose a pouring guru, Tiktus color art, and got to work.What do you guys think of my ~acrylic pouring adventure~?This video is NOT sponsored!!Safiya's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/Twitter: https://twitter.com/safiyajnFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/safnygaard/The tutorial we followed is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yndPwAMGEggYou can check out Tiktus’s channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeAvBShy5a2_vTFflQG_zWgMUSICVia AudioNetwork"

The window well filled up until the window could not hold the weight of the water any longer and it busted allowing over 4,000 gallons of water into our basement. We frantically tried to save everything we could but time ran out on some things.YESTERDAY's Video: https://youtu.be/dCoUZwnp674TANNERITES AND YAWI STORE: https://yawimerch.axomo.com/Welcome to the Yawi Vlogs Family Channel! We are a fun family of 9 (Mom, Dad, and 7 kids) trying to have as much fun in this incredible life and doing our best to remind everyone of their worth through our message You ARE Worth It or Yawi!Follow us onINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/yawivlogs/?...Snapchat @tanneritesTwitter: https://twitter.com/tannerites?lang=enFacebook:https://www.facebook.com/Tannerites/Check out our other ChannelsTANNERITES : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUvE...Nelly Knows:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvjo...Music By: Epidemic Sound http://share.epidemicsound.com/zZSmPFor Brand Partnerships, Business collaborations, and personal inquiries please email:business@tannerites.com#YouAREworthit #YAWI #TANNERITES/YAWI #Yawi"

She films and edits the “Squirmy and Grubs” vlog, which has over 670,000 subscribers on YouTube. Hannah has spoken at prestigious universities and Fortune 500 companies alike about the realities of ableism. On her popular Instagram account, she advocates for acceptance of all people and works to improve the way society thinks about disability.Shane and Hannah have been together for over four years. They got married in September of 2020 in the midst of a global pandemic in their backyard, with their officiant conducting the ceremony via Zoom. Their interabled relationship often confuses people, because much of society still cannot fathom people with disabilities being involved in loving, intimate relationships. Anyone who watches these episodes will quickly see their relationship is just as “normal” as any other. Sure, Hannah helps Shane use the bathroom and brush his teeth, but those activities do not detract from the emotional, intellectual, and physical connection they experience together."
