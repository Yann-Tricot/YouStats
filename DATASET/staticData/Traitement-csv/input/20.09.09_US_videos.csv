Apologies for the long absence, but we are trying to get things back on track. No, this video didn‚Äôt take us 3 months to make - we filmed a bunch of videos in July and this is the first of them to be released! It‚Äôs not a magnum opus, just supposed to be fun and lighthearted. If you want to read more about our plans, you can check out my blog post here:https://www.safiyasnewintrosong.com/single-post/2020/09/04/where-have-we-beenNow, onto the video! A few weeks ago, somewhere deep in a visual ASMR YouTube rabbit hole, I discovered the online acrylic pour art community - where people essentially make interesting color combos of paint in a cup, then pour that cup onto a canvas or object - and then manipulate that object to create truly mesmerizing, rainbow, psychedelic pieces of art. And I was instantly hooked - just something about the way the paints flow from the cup and then slide around the canvas really got me, ya know? So I decided to pick an acrylic pour art video and try to follow it myself, to see if I could do it too. So I chose a pouring guru, Tiktus color art, and got to work.What do you guys think of my ~acrylic pouring adventure~?This video is NOT sponsored!!Safiya's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/Twitter: https://twitter.com/safiyajnFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/safnygaard/The tutorial we followed is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yndPwAMGEggYou can check out Tiktus‚Äôs channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeAvBShy5a2_vTFflQG_zWgMUSICVia AudioNetwork"

A super big thanks to David Linderman, Jeremy Fielding, Trent, and David Woodall (the welder).I realize most people who support Smarter Every Day don't do it for transactional reasons, (ie, I'll support Smarter Every Day to get stuff).  I also realized that there is often a mental hurdle that must be crossed before support on Patreon starts.  My thought is that I'd really like to give folks a baseball, and it might provide enough momentum to get over that initial hurdle.  I signed the first shipment of baseballs I received, but I only have so many of those.  There's no implication that my signature is worth anything.... it's just kind of what you do with baseballs... it's a tradition.  After a certain number, it will transition to unsigned baseballs.  I've got enough signed baseballs to over all existing Patrons, and many more, but I will wait a month or so to see how many I need to get, then I'll order the second batch.  I like to support jobs and pay people for what they're good at.  The machinists and welders who made the parts in this video for example.  The whole intent here is to diversify away from solely being ad sponsored so I don't have to answer to anyone but myself and Patrons with respect to the types of content I choose to make.

Hannah has spoken at prestigious universities and Fortune 500 companies alike about the realities of ableism. On her popular Instagram account, she advocates for acceptance of all people and works to improve the way society thinks about disability.Shane and Hannah have been together for over four years. They got married in September of 2020 in the midst of a global pandemic in their backyard, with their officiant conducting the ceremony via Zoom. Their interabled relationship often confuses people, because much of society still cannot fathom people with disabilities being involved in loving, intimate relationships. Anyone who watches these episodes will quickly see their relationship is just as ‚Äúnormal‚Äù as any other. Sure, Hannah helps Shane use the bathroom and brush his teeth, but those activities do not detract from the emotional, intellectual, and physical connection they experience together."

Wakanda ForeverSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Talko-------------------------------------------------------------------------The tragic passing of the beloved actor, Chadwick Boseman has affected everyone. We will remember his role as King T‚ÄôChalla in Marvel‚Äôs Black Panther. We will also remember him as an inspirational person. He was very vocal about his passions. During his last moments, he spent his time at home, with his family and his wife. Unbeknownst to the world, Chadwick had married his finance, Taylor Simone Ledward after a long-lasting relationship. They were both very private people but showed their love for each other publicly. We will never forget the moment Chadwick declared his love for his future wife at the NAACP Awards. We will also never forget the beautiful photos of them smiling on red carpets and sitting courtside at basketball games. Many of their precious moments happened in California, the state is where Simone was born and raised. The couple spent much of their time in Los Angeles, California but Chadwick had also spent time in the U.K, Washington, and Brooklyn. When he settled down in California to pursue his acting career, he found his love, Simone. He started off with biopics of prominent figures and reached superstardom with his role as King T‚ÄôChalla in Black Panther, with Simone always by his side. Behind all the flashing lights, there was his private life. He had a very loving relationship with Simone. She was with him in his final moments. How will you remember Chadwick Boseman?

Today is a long awaited episode from my series Thrift Store Makeovers, where I take a used, worn out item (from a thrift store, yard sale, or in this case off of ebay) clean it up, fix it up and decorate it. I love hunting through thrift stores to find old, rejected items and then decorating them and putting my own style on them to turn them into new pieces of art. I've definitely missed these thrift flips and I want to do more thrifting soon!In this episode I am going to be painting on and customizing a vintage suitcase. This was such a long process, but also really fun (toward the end) and I'm really hoping you guys like the result.___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh üòÇ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL).

The Emergency Flying Ration Type 3, and the Emergency Ration Type P.  (This scene was filmed November 2018.) Then after these two rations another two tins are shown from a 1945 Compo (10 man) ration, and a Mess Tin Ration component (Which include some microscope shots making for an aimlessly colorful particle show of unknown non-living and some potentially living bacterial matter.) After these, we then take a look at a special sealed can from circa 1900, going back in time with something perfectly preserved and truly unforgettable. Finishing up with some long winded historical ramblings and a look at 120 + years in British Rations, including some incredibly old (and bloomed) chocolate .

After his research was stolen, The Blight was lured into the Realm of the Entity by the promise of new, forbidden knowledge. The new survivor is Felix Richter, an eccentric architect with a unique vision. Returning to the mysterious island where his father had disappeared, Felix descended into the darkness beyond and was never seen again.   COMING SOON.
