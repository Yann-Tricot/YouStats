Apologies for the long absence, but we are trying to get things back on track. No, this video didn’t take us 3 months to make - we filmed a bunch of videos in July and this is the first of them to be released! It’s not a magnum opus, just supposed to be fun and lighthearted. If you want to read more about our plans, you can check out my blog post here:https://www.safiyasnewintrosong.com/single-post/2020/09/04/where-have-we-beenNow, onto the video! A few weeks ago, somewhere deep in a visual ASMR YouTube rabbit hole, I discovered the online acrylic pour art community - where people essentially make interesting color combos of paint in a cup, then pour that cup onto a canvas or object - and then manipulate that object to create truly mesmerizing, rainbow, psychedelic pieces of art. And I was instantly hooked - just something about the way the paints flow from the cup and then slide around the canvas really got me, ya know? So I decided to pick an acrylic pour art video and try to follow it myself, to see if I could do it too. So I chose a pouring guru, Tiktus color art, and got to work.What do you guys think of my ~acrylic pouring adventure~?This video is NOT sponsored!!Safiya's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/Twitter: https://twitter.com/safiyajnFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/safnygaard/The tutorial we followed is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yndPwAMGEggYou can check out Tiktus’s channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeAvBShy5a2_vTFflQG_zWgMUSICVia AudioNetwork"

Wakanda ForeverSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Talko-------------------------------------------------------------------------The tragic passing of the beloved actor, Chadwick Boseman has affected everyone. We will remember his role as King T’Challa in Marvel’s Black Panther. We will also remember him as an inspirational person. He was very vocal about his passions. During his last moments, he spent his time at home, with his family and his wife. Unbeknownst to the world, Chadwick had married his finance, Taylor Simone Ledward after a long-lasting relationship. They were both very private people but showed their love for each other publicly. We will never forget the moment Chadwick declared his love for his future wife at the NAACP Awards. We will also never forget the beautiful photos of them smiling on red carpets and sitting courtside at basketball games. Many of their precious moments happened in California, the state is where Simone was born and raised. The couple spent much of their time in Los Angeles, California but Chadwick had also spent time in the U.K, Washington, and Brooklyn. When he settled down in California to pursue his acting career, he found his love, Simone. He started off with biopics of prominent figures and reached superstardom with his role as King T’Challa in Black Panther, with Simone always by his side. Behind all the flashing lights, there was his private life. He had a very loving relationship with Simone. She was with him in his final moments. How will you remember Chadwick Boseman?

Get your first month of KiwiCo for FREE!!! https://www.kiwico.com/markroberPoint of clarification:  A few people have pointed out the dates on the negative and positive Covid tests are the same.  You'll also notice my doctor was Bob Newby from Stranger Things.  Turns out there is a lot of personal info on a Covid result test and the part that says negative and positive wasn't easily readable so I photoshopped up something that solved both of those issues and didn't bother changing the date.  No conspiracy here.  I promise I actually got Covid and would have much preferred to actually filmed on the original schedule and not had to deal with it even with the private jet silver lining.Also, thanks to Discovery for putting my life in danger. #SharkWeek begins August 9th.
