Watch the trailer for the highly anticipated #DuneMovie now. -----------------https://www.facebook.com/dune https://twitter.com/dunemoviehttps://www.instagram.com/dunemovie-----------------Oscar  nominee  Denis  Villeneuve  (“Arrival,”  “Blade  Runner  2049”)  directs  Warner  Bros.  Pictures  and  Legendary Pictures’ “Dune,” the big-screen adaptation of Frank Herbert’s seminal bestseller of the same name. A mythic and emotionally charged hero’s journey, “Dune” tells the story of Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, who must travel to the most dangerous planet  in  the  universe  to  ensure  the  future  of  his  family  and  his  people.  As  malevolent  forces  explode  into conflict over the planet’s exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence—a commodity capable of unlocking humanity’s greatest potential—only those who can conquer their fear will survive.The film stars Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet (“Call Me by Your Name,”  “Little Women”), Rebecca Ferguson  (“Stephen  King’s  Doctor  Sleep,”   “Mission:  Impossible  –  Fallout”),  Oscar  Isaac  (the “Star  Wars” franchise) Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Milk,” “Avengers: Infinity War”), Stellan Skarsgård (HBO’s “Chernobyl,” “Avengers: Age of Ultron”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Avengers: Endgame”), Stephen McKinley Henderson (“Fences,” “Lady Bird”), Zendaya (“Spider-Man: Homecoming,” HBO’s “Euphoria”), Chang Chen (“Mr.  Long,” “Crouching  Tiger,  Hidden  Dragon”),    David  Dastmalchian  (“Blade  Runner  2049,”  “The  Dark  Knight”), Sharon  Duncan-Brewster  (“Rogue  One:  A  Star  Wars  Story,”  Netflix’s “Sex  Education”),   with  Oscar  nominee Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years,” “Assassin’s Creed”), with Jason Momoa (“Aquaman,” HBO’s “Game of Thrones”), and Oscar winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Skyfall”).   Villeneuve directed “Dune” from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth based on the novel of the same name written by Frank Herbert.  Villeneuve also produced the film with Mary Parent, Cale Boyter  and  Joe  Caracciolo,  Jr.   The  executive  producers  are  Tanya  Lapointe,  Joshua  Grode,  Herbert  W.  Gains, Jon Spaihts, Thomas Tull, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt and Kim Herbert. Behind  the  scenes,  Villeneuve  reteamed  with  two-time  Oscar-nominated  production  designer  Patrice  Vermette  (“Arrival,”  “Sicario,”  “The  Young  Victoria”),  two-time  Oscar-nominated  editor  Joe  Walker  (“Blade  Runner  2049,”  “Arrival,”  “12  Years  a  Slave”),  two-time  Oscar-winning  visual  effects  supervisor  Paul  Lambert  (“First Man,” “Blade Runner 2049”), and Oscar-winning special effects supervisor Gerd Nefzer (“Blade Runner 2049”).    He  also  collaborated  for  the  first  time  with  Oscar-nominated  director  of  photography  Greig  Fraser  (“Lion,”  “Zero  Dark  Thirty,”  “Rogue  One:  A  Star  Wars  Story”);  three-time  Oscar-nominated  costume  designer  Jacqueline West (“The Revenant,” “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” “Quills”) and co-costume designer Bob Morgan; and stunt coordinator Tom Struthers (“The Dark Knight” trilogy, “Inception”).  Oscar-winning and multiple  Oscar-nominated  composer  Hans  Zimmer  (“Blade  Runner  2049,”  “Inception,”  “Gladiator,”  “The  Lion King”) is creating the score.  Warner  Bros.  Pictures  and  Legendary  Pictures  Present  “Dune.”    The  film  is  slated  to  be  released  in  theaters on December 18, 2020."

I found it hard to find my words in this first time reaction and realization that we've really truly been all lied to regarding everything.The Mandalorian is all I have to look forward to.With Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni behind Star Wars, there is hope. As far as the sequels go, they're no longer in my timeline of Star Wars canon.I don't think the actors should ever be to blame. Neither should the writers and directors. You can't expect them to understand Star Wars. The higher ups who sign off on such a thing, especially when appointed by George Lucas like KK was, should have put her foot down and really course corrected things.Everything is so messed up, and the final nail is in.I hope things continue under Favreau.

That is a really good point and something that I can't let stand. In this video I show you how I devoted several weeks of my life to realizing a basketball hoop that makes your shot go in even if you totally miss the hoop.... it was a lot of fun, and quite a bit more challenging than I was anticipating. Hopefully you enjoy it :)Although very fun, these videos are very time consuming and expensive.

Apologies for the long absence, but we are trying to get things back on track. No, this video didn’t take us 3 months to make - we filmed a bunch of videos in July and this is the first of them to be released! It’s not a magnum opus, just supposed to be fun and lighthearted. If you want to read more about our plans, you can check out my blog post here:https://www.safiyasnewintrosong.com/single-post/2020/09/04/where-have-we-beenNow, onto the video! A few weeks ago, somewhere deep in a visual ASMR YouTube rabbit hole, I discovered the online acrylic pour art community - where people essentially make interesting color combos of paint in a cup, then pour that cup onto a canvas or object - and then manipulate that object to create truly mesmerizing, rainbow, psychedelic pieces of art. And I was instantly hooked - just something about the way the paints flow from the cup and then slide around the canvas really got me, ya know? So I decided to pick an acrylic pour art video and try to follow it myself, to see if I could do it too. So I chose a pouring guru, Tiktus color art, and got to work.What do you guys think of my ~acrylic pouring adventure~?This video is NOT sponsored!!Safiya's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/Twitter: https://twitter.com/safiyajnFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/safnygaard/The tutorial we followed is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yndPwAMGEggYou can check out Tiktus’s channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeAvBShy5a2_vTFflQG_zWgMUSICVia AudioNetwork"

A super big thanks to David Linderman, Jeremy Fielding, Trent, and David Woodall (the welder).I realize most people who support Smarter Every Day don't do it for transactional reasons, (ie, I'll support Smarter Every Day to get stuff).  I also realized that there is often a mental hurdle that must be crossed before support on Patreon starts.  My thought is that I'd really like to give folks a baseball, and it might provide enough momentum to get over that initial hurdle.  I signed the first shipment of baseballs I received, but I only have so many of those.  There's no implication that my signature is worth anything.... it's just kind of what you do with baseballs... it's a tradition.  After a certain number, it will transition to unsigned baseballs.  I've got enough signed baseballs to over all existing Patrons, and many more, but I will wait a month or so to see how many I need to get, then I'll order the second batch.  I like to support jobs and pay people for what they're good at.  The machinists and welders who made the parts in this video for example.

He is the President of a nonprofit organization called Laughing At My Nightmare, and a renowned public speaker who has performed across the country at places such as Harvard University, The University of Florida, The University of Connecticut, Princeton University, and many more.Hannah Aylward graduated from Carleton College, where she studied Sociology and Anthropology. She films and edits the “Squirmy and Grubs” vlog, which has over 670,000 subscribers on YouTube. Hannah has spoken at prestigious universities and Fortune 500 companies alike about the realities of ableism. On her popular Instagram account, she advocates for acceptance of all people and works to improve the way society thinks about disability.Shane and Hannah have been together for over four years. They got married in September of 2020 in the midst of a global pandemic in their backyard, with their officiant conducting the ceremony via Zoom. Their interabled relationship often confuses people, because much of society still cannot fathom people with disabilities being involved in loving, intimate relationships. Anyone who watches these episodes will quickly see their relationship is just as “normal” as any other. Sure, Hannah helps Shane use the bathroom and brush his teeth, but those activities do not detract from the emotional, intellectual, and physical connection they experience together."

Once he did that, Contractions became pretty strong and steady and her body started to labor on its own. At around 1pm Joy started pushing and our baby girl arrived at 2:12pm! The baby was posterior (sunny side up), so that explains why Joy had such terrible back labor and why she had to push so long! So thankful that Mom and Baby are doing good!!!"

It offers us the tools to stay present with ourselves and to be present with one another in the NOW. Now can be uncertain, uncomfortable, and at times, not fun. We long for time with friends, activities that feel supportive, we miss togetherness, and we fear for the future. Take time to fill your cup, practice feeling your own presence, and share sacred space with one another!

Wakanda ForeverSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-Talko-------------------------------------------------------------------------The tragic passing of the beloved actor, Chadwick Boseman has affected everyone. We will remember his role as King T’Challa in Marvel’s Black Panther. We will also remember him as an inspirational person. He was very vocal about his passions. During his last moments, he spent his time at home, with his family and his wife. Unbeknownst to the world, Chadwick had married his finance, Taylor Simone Ledward after a long-lasting relationship. They were both very private people but showed their love for each other publicly. We will never forget the moment Chadwick declared his love for his future wife at the NAACP Awards. We will also never forget the beautiful photos of them smiling on red carpets and sitting courtside at basketball games. Many of their precious moments happened in California, the state is where Simone was born and raised. The couple spent much of their time in Los Angeles, California but Chadwick had also spent time in the U.K, Washington, and Brooklyn. When he settled down in California to pursue his acting career, he found his love, Simone. He started off with biopics of prominent figures and reached superstardom with his role as King T’Challa in Black Panther, with Simone always by his side. Behind all the flashing lights, there was his private life. He had a very loving relationship with Simone. She was with him in his final moments. How will you remember Chadwick Boseman?

This is the result! In this episode, we build the cabin and add transparent PVC roofing panels to it. Perfect for stargazing! The clear roofing isn't just for looks and lighting though, it can also be used for heating during the winter! Much in the same way that a greenhouse passively heats itself using sunlight. So cool! Throw in some led string lights, and it looks like hundreds of fireflies have come to rest on the cabin roof. (*Editor's note: Yeah, I realize that I kept calling it plexiglass roofing. ...Silly me. lol It's actually PVC roofing panels. ...just FYI)Pop-Up Cabin plans can be purchased ($9 USD) for download here:https://sowl.co/beQESoThe comprehensive plans include: step-by-step instructions, cut list, and diagrams, which show exactly how the cabin was assembled from the ground up.
