Today is a super exciting nw project, I've NEVER seen anyone do this before, Jackie from NerdEcrafter and I have decided to try customizing plushies for the first time. This is a lot like squishy makeovers, but with plushies instead!Since this has never been done before, we are having to get very experimental. I ended up using a combination of techniques and materials to give my plushie a makeover. I will be doing some basic sewing, gluing, using felt, ribbon, and lots of fabric paint as usual! We decided to us Squishmallows to customize since they are so simple and really cute.

I'm 25 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating and painting videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess.

For 2021 he replaces Sergio Perez, and will slot in alongside Lance Stroll. It's a marquee signing for the team's Aston rebrand next year, and gives it a world champion driver at a time when it wants to take the next step up to becoming a race-winning team. But is success for this partnership a slam dunk? In this video, Scott Mitchell looks at the risks on both sides, as Vettel hopes the team can build some real upward momentum, Racing Point banks on getting the fired-up version of Vettel, and we take a moment to spare a thought for Perez for being left on the sidelines by a team he has played a pivotal role with for many years.READ MORE HERE: - Our verdict on Vettel's move: https://the-race.com/formula-1/our-verdict-on-vettels-aston-martin-f1-move/- Why Perez should leave F1: https://the-race.com/formula-1/sergio-perez-should-leave-f1-after-aston-martin-snub/Subscribe: http://the-race.com/youtube_subscribeWebsite: http://the-race.com/Twitter: http://twitter.com/WeAreTheRaceInstagram: http://instagram.com/WeAreTheRaceFacebook: http://facebook.com/WeAreTheRacePodcasts: http://the-race.com/podcastsThanks for watching - please like, share and comment, please also hit subscribe to show your support so we'll keep doing what we're doing.#Formula1 #Vettel #AstonMartinhttps://www.the-race.comhttp://www.twitter.com/wearetherace"

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.For her Tiny Desk (home) concert, Phoebe Bridgers chose the White House. OK, maybe it's a green screen, but she and her team created a sweet mock-up of the Oval Office, with Phoebe performing behind a very special desk. It's a far cry from the hotel bed in Austin we first filmed Phoebe on back in 2017, but her ambitions and talent run high. She played the Tiny Desk later that year and returned with newfound bandmates, Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker, as boygenius one year later. But there was more to come when she surprised us all for a magical collaboration with her musical hero Conor Oberst as Better Oblivion Community Center just six months later.Phoebe and bandmates Marshall Vore on drums and Harrison Whitford on guitar perform three songs from her brilliant new album, Punisher. They open with Kyoto, a story song based on her first trip to Japan, followed with a sweet version of Moon Song and the sad details of loving someone who doesn't love themself. And then comes the kicker, as Phoebe introduces herself with the words I hope everybody's enjoying their apocalypse, as the band kicks into her surreal doomsday tune I Know the End. And what an end it is: The trio expands to an ensemble and a crowd-sourced chorus of fans — recording from bedrooms, cars, backyards and trampolines — lets out the kind of cathartic scream that has come to define 2020 for so many of us.Phoebe for President, 2020.SET LISTKyotoMoon SongI Know The EndMUSICIANSPhoebe Bridgers: vocals, guitar; Marshall Vore: drums, vocals; Harrison Whitford: guitar; Emily Retsas: bass; Nick White: keyboard; Odessa Jorgensen: violinCREDITSVideo by: Lucas Belkind, Dalton Gaudin, Jason Lester, Powell Robinson; Audio by: Joseph Lorge; Producer: Bob Boilen; Audio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Video Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann"

As far as the sequels go, they're no longer in my timeline of Star Wars canon.I don't think the actors should ever be to blame. Neither should the writers and directors. You can't expect them to understand Star Wars. The higher ups who sign off on such a thing, especially when appointed by George Lucas like KK was, should have put her foot down and really course corrected things.Everything is so messed up, and the final nail is in.I hope things continue under Favreau.

That is a really good point and something that I can't let stand. In this video I show you how I devoted several weeks of my life to realizing a basketball hoop that makes your shot go in even if you totally miss the hoop.... it was a lot of fun, and quite a bit more challenging than I was anticipating. Hopefully you enjoy it :)Although very fun, these videos are very time consuming and expensive.

It was a huge challenge to whittle the 450gigs of footage down into a video that shared my journey of designing and getting this machine working.

One question - would a podcast be interesting yes / no? I've been considering that as an opportunity to share more details and whatnot that can't make it into my videos."

A super big thanks to David Linderman, Jeremy Fielding, Trent, and David Woodall (the welder).I realize most people who support Smarter Every Day don't do it for transactional reasons, (ie, I'll support Smarter Every Day to get stuff).  I also realized that there is often a mental hurdle that must be crossed before support on Patreon starts.  My thought is that I'd really like to give folks a baseball, and it might provide enough momentum to get over that initial hurdle.  I signed the first shipment of baseballs I received, but I only have so many of those.  There's no implication that my signature is worth anything.... it's just kind of what you do with baseballs... it's a tradition.  After a certain number, it will transition to unsigned baseballs.  I've got enough signed baseballs to over all existing Patrons, and many more, but I will wait a month or so to see how many I need to get, then I'll order the second batch.  I like to support jobs and pay people for what they're good at.  The machinists and welders who made the parts in this video for example.  The whole intent here is to diversify away from solely being ad sponsored so I don't have to answer to anyone but myself and Patrons with respect to the types of content I choose to make.

Apologies for the long absence, but we are trying to get things back on track. No, this video didn’t take us 3 months to make - we filmed a bunch of videos in July and this is the first of them to be released! It’s not a magnum opus, just supposed to be fun and lighthearted. If you want to read more about our plans, you can check out my blog post here:https://www.safiyasnewintrosong.com/single-post/2020/09/04/where-have-we-beenNow, onto the video! A few weeks ago, somewhere deep in a visual ASMR YouTube rabbit hole, I discovered the online acrylic pour art community - where people essentially make interesting color combos of paint in a cup, then pour that cup onto a canvas or object - and then manipulate that object to create truly mesmerizing, rainbow, psychedelic pieces of art. And I was instantly hooked - just something about the way the paints flow from the cup and then slide around the canvas really got me, ya know? So I decided to pick an acrylic pour art video and try to follow it myself, to see if I could do it too. So I chose a pouring guru, Tiktus color art, and got to work.What do you guys think of my ~acrylic pouring adventure~?This video is NOT sponsored!!Safiya's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/Twitter: https://twitter.com/safiyajnFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/safnygaard/The tutorial we followed is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yndPwAMGEggYou can check out Tiktus’s channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeAvBShy5a2_vTFflQG_zWgMUSICVia AudioNetwork"
