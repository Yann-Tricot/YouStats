Watch the trailer for the highly anticipated #DuneMovie now. -----------------https://www.facebook.com/dune https://twitter.com/dunemoviehttps://www.instagram.com/dunemovie-----------------Oscar  nominee  Denis  Villeneuve  (“Arrival,”  “Blade  Runner  2049”)  directs  Warner  Bros.  Pictures  and  Legendary Pictures’ “Dune,” the big-screen adaptation of Frank Herbert’s seminal bestseller of the same name. A mythic and emotionally charged hero’s journey, “Dune” tells the story of Paul Atreides, a brilliant and gifted young man born into a great destiny beyond his understanding, who must travel to the most dangerous planet  in  the  universe  to  ensure  the  future  of  his  family  and  his  people.  As  malevolent  forces  explode  into conflict over the planet’s exclusive supply of the most precious resource in existence—a commodity capable of unlocking humanity’s greatest potential—only those who can conquer their fear will survive.The film stars Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet (“Call Me by Your Name,”  “Little Women”), Rebecca Ferguson  (“Stephen  King’s  Doctor  Sleep,”   “Mission:  Impossible  –  Fallout”),  Oscar  Isaac  (the “Star  Wars” franchise) Oscar nominee Josh Brolin (“Milk,” “Avengers: Infinity War”), Stellan Skarsgård (HBO’s “Chernobyl,” “Avengers: Age of Ultron”), Dave Bautista (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “Avengers: Endgame”), Stephen McKinley Henderson (“Fences,” “Lady Bird”), Zendaya (“Spider-Man: Homecoming,” HBO’s “Euphoria”), Chang Chen (“Mr.  Long,” “Crouching  Tiger,  Hidden  Dragon”),    David  Dastmalchian  (“Blade  Runner  2049,”  “The  Dark  Knight”), Sharon  Duncan-Brewster  (“Rogue  One:  A  Star  Wars  Story,”  Netflix’s “Sex  Education”),   with  Oscar  nominee Charlotte Rampling (“45 Years,” “Assassin’s Creed”), with Jason Momoa (“Aquaman,” HBO’s “Game of Thrones”), and Oscar winner Javier Bardem (“No Country for Old Men,” “Skyfall”).   Villeneuve directed “Dune” from a screenplay he co-wrote with Jon Spaihts and Eric Roth based on the novel of the same name written by Frank Herbert.  Villeneuve also produced the film with Mary Parent, Cale Boyter  and  Joe  Caracciolo,  Jr.   The  executive  producers  are  Tanya  Lapointe,  Joshua  Grode,  Herbert  W.  Gains, Jon Spaihts, Thomas Tull, Brian Herbert, Byron Merritt and Kim Herbert. Behind  the  scenes,  Villeneuve  reteamed  with  two-time  Oscar-nominated  production  designer  Patrice  Vermette  (“Arrival,”  “Sicario,”  “The  Young  Victoria”),  two-time  Oscar-nominated  editor  Joe  Walker  (“Blade  Runner  2049,”  “Arrival,”  “12  Years  a  Slave”),  two-time  Oscar-winning  visual  effects  supervisor  Paul  Lambert  (“First Man,” “Blade Runner 2049”), and Oscar-winning special effects supervisor Gerd Nefzer (“Blade Runner 2049”).    He  also  collaborated  for  the  first  time  with  Oscar-nominated  director  of  photography  Greig  Fraser  (“Lion,”  “Zero  Dark  Thirty,”  “Rogue  One:  A  Star  Wars  Story”);  three-time  Oscar-nominated  costume  designer  Jacqueline West (“The Revenant,” “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” “Quills”) and co-costume designer Bob Morgan; and stunt coordinator Tom Struthers (“The Dark Knight” trilogy, “Inception”).  Oscar-winning and multiple  Oscar-nominated  composer  Hans  Zimmer  (“Blade  Runner  2049,”  “Inception,”  “Gladiator,”  “The  Lion King”) is creating the score.  Warner  Bros.  Pictures  and  Legendary  Pictures  Present  “Dune.”    The  film  is  slated  to  be  released  in  theaters on December 18, 2020."

I'm so happy to be able to work with my friend again. We wanted to make a unique and fun DIY craft that we've never seen being done on youtube before. Much like Squishy Makeovers, this diy project transforms squishmallows into custom dolls. This is the first custom doll plushies I've ever made and they are ooak! I used Tulip fabric paints, acrylic paints, solarcolordust airbrush, and felt...and of course SPRINKLES. @Moriah Elizabeth and I were supposed to have a fun in-person collaboration this summer, but with everything going on, we decided to do this fun idea instead. We went with the idea that we would make one plushie in the style of the other (I would make one sweet and 2 darkness creatures), and she would make (1 darkness, and 2 sweetness). I'm so happy to have creative friends in our community.💜💛 Want to support future projects on my channel?

I ended up using a combination of techniques and materials to give my plushie a makeover. I will be doing some basic sewing, gluing, using felt, ribbon, and lots of fabric paint as usual!

Apologies for the long absence, but we are trying to get things back on track.

If you want to read more about our plans, you can check out my blog post here:https://www.safiyasnewintrosong.com/single-post/2020/09/04/where-have-we-beenNow, onto the video! A few weeks ago, somewhere deep in a visual ASMR YouTube rabbit hole, I discovered the online acrylic pour art community - where people essentially make interesting color combos of paint in a cup, then pour that cup onto a canvas or object - and then manipulate that object to create truly mesmerizing, rainbow, psychedelic pieces of art. And I was instantly hooked - just something about the way the paints flow from the cup and then slide around the canvas really got me, ya know? So I decided to pick an acrylic pour art video and try to follow it myself, to see if I could do it too. So I chose a pouring guru, Tiktus color art, and got to work.What do you guys think of my ~acrylic pouring adventure~?This video is NOT sponsored!!Safiya's Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/safiyany/Twitter: https://twitter.com/safiyajnFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/safnygaard/The tutorial we followed is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yndPwAMGEggYou can check out Tiktus’s channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeAvBShy5a2_vTFflQG_zWgMUSICVia AudioNetwork"

I build up a new enduro MTB before going to Germany to ride the sickest jumps and freeride MTB lines of the year! How sick is this bike?Thanks to Ghost bikes I was able to receive this amazing new bike, the 4.7 slamr which is a 140mm front and 130mm rear suspension enduro bike which doubles up as a big slopestyle bike and its perfect! I build up the bike at home and do some fresh modifications to the bike including new halo wheels and Magura brakes before heading for a tiny test ride at my local woods. I also introduce you to my new car that i'm sure you will love! After landing a couple of tricks at home it was then time to leave and make my way across Europe into Germany to ride the Audi Nines freeride event. On arrival at the Audi Nines quarry I jump straight into a course walk through all of the new features that are on offer throughout this crazy bikers dream! For today's video I session the slopestyle line on my new enduro bike and end up pulling off some sick tricks that i never though would be possible on this bike. I will be out here in Germany for a week filled with riding with my jump bike, downhill bike, electric bike and my new enduro mountain bike! I'm very excited to see what the week brings, what tricks would you like to see? Let me know in the comments!!

Get that right, and the local microorganisms and insects will soon transform your kitchen and garden waste into rich, healthy, sweet-smelling compost. A handful of compost can contain a billion microorganisms.   Costa sets up a simple system with two upright plastic compost bins - the ones with no base, although he covers them with some chicken wire to keep out vermin. Simply find a spot that’s out of the way, not in full sun, away from tree roots, and sitting on soil. Ideally you have two bins so, after one has been filled, you can leave it to decompose while you fill the second bin.  There’s no secret recipe or ‘right or wrong’ to making compost, but it’s important to keep a balance of carbon-rich, brown material (used for energy) and nitrogen-rich greens (used to reproduce and grow). Green is the nitrogen-rich fresh material that includes kitchen scraps, grass clippings, fresh weeds, coffee grounds and tea leaves - even chicken feathers and poo.  Brown material can include dry leaves, straw from animal bedding, wood chips, shredded paper, and ripped-up egg cartons. When you’re starting, it’s also best to keep meat, wheat and dairy out, as they can attract vermin. Start with a layer of dry carbon material, which has air pocked and allows oxygen to get into the system. Then, every time you add a layer of green material, add a layer of brown on top, and water it in. Costa starts this layering even in his kitchen tidy. Rather than laying newspaper flat, rip it into streamers and try to incorporate as much air with it as possible - Costa has a little dance that helps do this…. Adding layers gradually like this and then leaving it to decompose is called cold composting. There is also a system that speeds up the process, called hot composting; this requires a larger compost pile, specific brown and green ratios, and regular turning.  Unless you are running a large, hot-composting heap in excess of 1m3, avoid introducing plants with pests or pathogens (like mildews) or weeds with seed heads or bulbs – these can persist in compost and be spread around the garden via the compost later.  But, don’t just bin those weeds - you can use them to make a weed tea, a DIY liquid fertiliser that’s good for your garden and your compost heap. Whack your weeds into an old pillowcase, hessian bag, or wrap them in shadecloth – the greener and fresher the weeds, the better! Bunging weeds into a bag stops the seeds being spread, and the brew from clogging your watering-can rose. Dump this weed ‘tea bag’ into a big bucket of water, cover, and let it sit for a couple of days, stirring when you remember. Once your weed tea has steeped, use the tea diluted in a ratio of 1:3 in a watering can and use it to water edible plants such as leafy greens, or pour it on your compost heap to give it a kick along!  The watered-down weeds can go into your green-waste bin – they’ve served their purpose.

I FINALLY moved in my #college apartment! Come along with me as I pack up my Jeep and head out on the 19hr drive to Utah, move my stuff in, and shop for room decor! Then watch my final GOODBYES with my mom and dad! ✅ Check out my NEW IG PHOTO DOODLES  Photo Presets, & Stickers HERE: https://brooklynandbaileyshop.com/collections/presets-doodles My dad drove with me out to Utah, and it was a LOOOOONNNNGGGG day! We drove it all straight through, no stops for meals, only three gas stops and two sites along the way... the Cadillac Ranch outside Amarillo, TX and the Breaking Bad house in Albuquerque, NM. We pulled into my grandparent's house at about 2:30am and crashed!The next morning, my mom flew in to help me and my dad move my stuff in #movein. We also shopped pretty much for two days straight trying to get apartment and room decor. Since we were unable to visit the property before signing the lease and getting to Utah (due to the pandemic), we had no idea how the room looked and what the lighting situation looked like. So we opted to buy pretty much anything I needed there, rather than haul pre-bought stuff out in a U-Haul only to find that it didn't work with the room/lighting. We much have visited 7-8 Targets trying to get the right stuff! We weren't counting on over 70,000 students being in Provo/Orem area all on the same weekend moving into BYU and Utah Valley University!Since I am starting college as a Sophomore in credits, I opted for an apartment with my own room instead of a #dormroom.  After we decorated my room, it was time to say goodbye to my parents. I had just left the rest of the family in Texas a few days earlier, so I was getting used to it by now. It was still sad, but I'm super excited to be in college, get to know my roommates, enjoy the outdoors, and be closer to my extended family!What was your favorite part of this move-in vlog?

No, it was not.The utter lack of care and direction regarding the sequel trilogy has me beyond bothered. I found it hard to find my words in this first time reaction and realization that we've really truly been all lied to regarding everything.The Mandalorian is all I have to look forward to.With Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni behind Star Wars, there is hope. As far as the sequels go, they're no longer in my timeline of Star Wars canon.I don't think the actors should ever be to blame. Neither should the writers and directors. You can't expect them to understand Star Wars. The higher ups who sign off on such a thing, especially when appointed by George Lucas like KK was, should have put her foot down and really course corrected things.Everything is so messed up, and the final nail is in.I hope things continue under Favreau.

For the last 10 years Harry and a handful of open-minded free surfers have managed to scrape livings as an aspirational, relatable, journeyman aesthete. For Harry and surfers like him, their marketability has come not in spite of, but because of, his abstinence from anything like mainstream high-performance equipment, ie. the modern thruster. And this makes some people very angry. Many of you watching this right now have long held the belief that the heavily-glassed, elegantly tinted alternative equipment these “hipster kooks” ride has concealed fundamental flaws in their surfing. Put these guys on a real surfboard, you say. Then we’ll see how pretty they look.”This is what happens when you put one of surfing’s foremost alternative stylists on teamlite foam and fiberglass."

That is a really good point and something that I can't let stand. In this video I show you how I devoted several weeks of my life to realizing a basketball hoop that makes your shot go in even if you totally miss the hoop.... it was a lot of fun, and quite a bit more challenging than I was anticipating. Hopefully you enjoy it :)Although very fun, these videos are very time consuming and expensive.

A super big thanks to David Linderman, Jeremy Fielding, Trent, and David Woodall (the welder).I realize most people who support Smarter Every Day don't do it for transactional reasons, (ie, I'll support Smarter Every Day to get stuff).  I also realized that there is often a mental hurdle that must be crossed before support on Patreon starts.  My thought is that I'd really like to give folks a baseball, and it might provide enough momentum to get over that initial hurdle.  I signed the first shipment of baseballs I received, but I only have so many of those.  There's no implication that my signature is worth anything.... it's just kind of what you do with baseballs... it's a tradition.  After a certain number, it will transition to unsigned baseballs.  I've got enough signed baseballs to over all existing Patrons, and many more, but I will wait a month or so to see how many I need to get, then I'll order the second batch.  I like to support jobs and pay people for what they're good at.  The machinists and welders who made the parts in this video for example.  The whole intent here is to diversify away from solely being ad sponsored so I don't have to answer to anyone but myself and Patrons with respect to the types of content I choose to make.

For 2021 he replaces Sergio Perez, and will slot in alongside Lance Stroll. It's a marquee signing for the team's Aston rebrand next year, and gives it a world champion driver at a time when it wants to take the next step up to becoming a race-winning team. But is success for this partnership a slam dunk? In this video, Scott Mitchell looks at the risks on both sides, as Vettel hopes the team can build some real upward momentum, Racing Point banks on getting the fired-up version of Vettel, and we take a moment to spare a thought for Perez for being left on the sidelines by a team he has played a pivotal role with for many years.READ MORE HERE: - Our verdict on Vettel's move: https://the-race.com/formula-1/our-verdict-on-vettels-aston-martin-f1-move/- Why Perez should leave F1: https://the-race.com/formula-1/sergio-perez-should-leave-f1-after-aston-martin-snub/Subscribe: http://the-race.com/youtube_subscribeWebsite: http://the-race.com/Twitter: http://twitter.com/WeAreTheRaceInstagram: http://instagram.com/WeAreTheRaceFacebook: http://facebook.com/WeAreTheRacePodcasts: http://the-race.com/podcastsThanks for watching - please like, share and comment, please also hit subscribe to show your support so we'll keep doing what we're doing.#Formula1 #Vettel #AstonMartinhttps://www.the-race.comhttp://www.twitter.com/wearetherace"

If you draw up a map, trace a line connecting the island of Bermuda, Puerto Rico, Miami, and back to Bermuda, what do you get?  Yes, it’s a triangle – a sinister polygon known for mysteriously swallowing over 2,000 ships and 200 aircraft over centuries! And here's a story about the Bermuda Triangle you probably didn’t hear about. So, the airplane involved was a Beechcraft Bonanza single-engine aircraft. Onboard, pilot Bruce Gernon had two passengers: his father and business partner. They took off from Andros Island in the Bahamas and headed northwest for the Florida coast. It was December 4, 1970. This was a typical flight Bruce had made dozens of times before! But this time would be different. They would face really unexplainable and maybe even mysterious things…#brightsidePreview photo credit: Lancaster, USA - March 24, 2018, Beechcraft F33C Bonanza on display during Los Angeles County Air Show at William J.
